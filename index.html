Perhaps one of my favorite aspects about this class, besides Ken’s obvious enthusiasm and passion for the environment, is the exposure that it provides me to a wide range of literary and cinematic pieces regarding climate change. I can certainly say that I would have never read something like Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions if it weren’t forced upon me as an assignment. But I’m so glad that this class introduced me to this reading because I think it’s an extremely useful tool for those that want to spread urgency regarding the climate disaster. The extended metaphor regarding convincing our own “Uncle Pete” of anthropogenic climate change made absorbing what was being said just that much easier. Uncle Pete symbolizes every stubborn, conservative and science-doubting person in our lives that refuses to believe what you have to say about climate change no matter how strong the evidence you have is. The author, Richard Sommerville, brought up some of the most pertinent arguments that this category of “Uncle Pete” like people make. For example, in discussing climate change with some of my own family members, I have repeatedly come across the counter-argument that scientists have constructed the issue of climate change just so that the government could pursue a larger control over our private lives. I’ve always found this argument somewhat troubling to combat because I’m never prepared with an argument to counter it. To me, this argument is simply just falling in line with the partisan views that have split the issue, which should have never been the case. Although, the reading informed me of the necessary steps in communication to take in order to engage with people like this.       
<br><br>
 One facet in the reading that I found resonated with me the most was concerning language use. I think the words that we use have an underestimated importance regarding their influence on the strength of our argument. As Ken focused on in his video, the use of one wrong word could completely disinterest your audience. His personal anecdote of labeling himself as a vegan and people automatically dismissing him as an environmental extremist shows just how critical language is. When engaging with people who are less informed about our current climate crisis, presenting yourself as a die-hard supporter of taking climate action can understandably scare them off. In trying to educate people about the climate crisis, the whole goal is to get them to feel that you can be trusted as a source of information. By immediately exposing yourself as an environmental enthusiast, it fosters an impression in your audience that you’re going to be biased in the information you present to them. All in all, the key points presented by Sommerville in the reading provides a basic outline for how one should alter their communication tactics when engaging in a discussion about the climate crisis with others.

I similarly find this reading a very useful tool, especially after watching “Climate of Doubt” and “Merchants of Doubt” in which I found watching and listening to climate skeptics simply infuriating, though had no idea as to how to change it. Somerville highlights various popular myths and falsehoods that people akin to “Uncle Pete” might use to bolster their argument against anthropogenic climate change or justify the continuance of their own detrimental actions; he then proposes a counterargument that can be used while engaged in a civil and mutually respectable conversations with skeptics.
<br><br>

I found the language section quite interesting; often scientists struggle to present their research, findings, data, charts, etc. in a way that makes sense to the general public. Using scientific jargon can also confuse or even mislead people. One of the figures Somerville provided showed the various meanings of words to both a scientist and an ordinary person or non-scientist where the terms “positive feedback” and “enhanced” could be mistaken as good things when in fact, they are being used to denote something completely different.
<br><br>

As Ken mentioned with the stigma of veganism and how off-putting or alienating it can be, I have found this is also the case with talking about the climate crisis in general. Many people, unlike the “Uncle Pete” character or friends/ family that are concerned about the climate crisis, simply don’t want to talk about it at all. It is often because of a cynical perspective on the future of the environment and our planet that is difficult to wrap our heads around, given the scale and severity of the topic. While I wouldn’t go so far as to insinuate these kinds of people are experiencing the newly coined “climate anxiety”, I would say that it is possible they are desensitized to the urgency of the matter and have numbly and detachedly accepted a Wallace-Wells “doomsday” future and feel it is pointless to change course, if it were even possible. I wonder how I would converse with these kinds of people, as I feel I encounter them more often than the other two options Ken presented.

I agree with your description about "Uncle Pete" who is skeptic and refuses to accept the scientific truth of climate change. Many common citizens politicians, conservative think tanks, and news reporters behave similarly as Uncle Pete. Like you said, the reading also reminds me our underestimated importance regarding our use of language when trying to persuade audiences. For example, I would definitely avoid too much scientific jargon when communicating with children and the elder in my family, instead I would put some simple truths and remind them of the fundamental realities of the climate crisis such as "We' are the reason" and "We can stop it". When communicating with other college students or our parents, I may explain in a more detailed approach for them to thoroughly understand this issue. I also agree with you that we should let people feel that we can be trusted as a source of information.

I really appreciated your comment. Particularly the beginning when you stated that you would not have likely read this material without it being forced on you as an assignment-- I really appreciate your honesty there. I agree that this class introduced me too to such a wide variety of material-- films, movies, youtube videos, etc. But with regards to your "Uncle Pete" reference... we all have that Uncle Pete in our lives. Luckily all of my family believes in science and the climate crisis, but I do know friends who have family members who say climate change is a hoax. Our own President believes it, which is really sad. I think it is critical that we try our best to teach others about the seriousness of this global threat.

I also have some uncle Pete's with my family and friends. But what I also realized is I am not taking any action to change my diet or the way I live. How can I communicate with my family and friends of how bad climate change is  if I do not do it myself.  That is the main problem of my communication and will need to be able to put my own effort before telling anyone else what my ideas are. 
<br><br>


I also Believed that the Language was super important in explaining about climate crisis. Ken did indeed explain this briefly on this video. I think that Climaterian is a great way to communicate new people to learn how to help climate change. I like how you have a many more choices then being a climaterian. Instead of eating a burger, you can eat turkey. You do not necessarily have to quit eating meat like vegans do, you can just cut back and meat that cause higher concentrations of green gas emissions which is mainly beef. Also being a  freeganlist also has many chocies as well. Instead of throwing away left over food, JUST EAT IT. All of these are easy fixes but it now only depends on how climaterian and fregganist portray themselves to people like you have stated.

I completely agree with your initial statement - I've been exposed to so many different sources of climate change information thanks to this class. If I'm being honest, I would have likely never come across these sources , minus the Netflix documentaries. I have always found it difficult to communicate the issue of climate change with people around me, whether they're unaware of or flat out deniers. Richard Sommerville does a great job at simplifying how to communicate with these sort of people and not coming across as a know it all, morally superior asshole. I must admit that it's frustrating at times when you want someone to understand your perspective and opinions but they're so stuck in their beliefs. As I type that out, I seem to understand more and more just what Sommerville details in his writings. You have to understand your audience and explain it in a way that doesn't completely shut down their beliefs. Its almost like teaching - I middle school teacher must understand how middle schoolers best learn and adapt to new information, and then go ahead and teach the middle school class. Same goes with trying to communicate climate change with people of different beliefs and ideologies.

I agree with the readings use of using the Uncle Pete idea to give the readers a greater sense of understanding. I found it hard watching politicians argue against climate change because although I knew they were wrong I didn't really understand the full extent of their actions and how those that actually understand climate change actually feel towards these deniers. Using Uncle Pete served as a  great symbol to understand how these deniers are in a real world sense and I definitely grasped a better understanding towards the view against deniers. I totally relate to how you mentioned talking to your family about climate issues and facing trouble. My family as well would not seemingly be open to having a talk and understanding climate change in the past. However, I believe that more recently my family has become more conscious of what is truly happening and are beginning to be have a more open mindset and understanding climate change talks. I think this idea of Uncle Pete serves great purpose to provide a negative symbol for the audience, but I think it should be our goal as a society to eliminate this Uncle Pete we have in our government today as our planet has no time for anymore disruptions at the dinner table before its too late.

I completely agree. I honestly never would have read this or even really thought about it until I took this course. How you phrase things and how you come across to people when you talk about something you are passionate about seems like common sense until you read a chapter such as this one that illustrates the importance of effective phrasing and delivery of information. I am vegan, and to avoid the stereotypical view of being vegan, I make a conscious effort to not judge other people's lifestyles or try and push my lifestyle onto others. But, I have always wished that there was a way to educate people on why mindful eating is important without coming across as an arrogant, holier than thou vegan. This chapter and Ken’s video were immensely helpful with that.  I also agree with your statement that language is vitally important. I need to work on learning better word choices and educating myself on how to educate others! It sounds backwards, but is crucial to spread awareness and information. Finally, the Uncle Pete metaphor, as you stated, was very helpful and I will definitely apply it to situations with similar friends and family members. It is hard to articulate responses to these people, but now I have some guidelines! Although, I wish we had read this before Thanksgiving break…




<br><hr>
As do many others, I completely agree with your whole comment. I, too, most likely would never have read a chapter from this book on my own, or even have known of its existence without this course. I am truly appreciative of all of the resources Ken provides for us, especially the various film choices since in my experiences, they are a more appealing way of receiving information about the climate crisis to those who have no prior knowledge. I have already shared some of my favorite films we have watched such as Before the Flood and the Paradise documentary with my close friends and family, and they have found them interesting and informative! Personally, I have not had an encounter with any "Uncle Pete's" yet in my life, but when that time comes I feel more prepared on how to effectively communicate the climate crisis in the best way possible. 

<br><br>

I also found the language portion of the chapter the most interesting because I know it will be extremely beneficial to me. This class has already inspired me to becoming an environmental activist and spread the knowledge I have learned to as many as I can. I have already started on this journey; through Ken in this video and from the chapter of reading I realized that I was doing it all wrong. I was actually doing it in the exact opposite way that is most effective. Typically I would start off with a "Did you know...?" statement to one of my friends and spiral into a regurgitation of the statistics, consequences, and solutions to the climate crisis. I had no idea how overwhelming this might have been to the recipient and ultimately ineffective to what I was trying to portray. I really appreciate this segment because I can move forward in my form of activism knowing the best way to communicate so that those listening can hopefully act to also fight the climate crisis. I really do believe that one of the best ways to mitigate the climate crisis is through activism and education. It may seem that no one cares about the planet or the environment, and for some that may ring true. However, in my own experiences just in these short weeks of taking this course I have noticed most people just do not know. This type of information is not common knowledge, and the severity of the situation is not widely known either. Yes, I believe most know that the climate crisis is here and real, but I think the surface level information that most know is not enough to fully embody what the climate crisis entails. I hope many of us can use these tools Ken has provided to do our part to spread the right information in the right way in order to get more people engaged in mitigating the climate crisis.

In response to your comment, I as well was never really exposed to the literature and film that we have seen and continue to see through this class. If anything, before this class I wasn’t really used to reading anything on a daily basis and I’m glad this class has allowed me to find a love for reading and watching educational materials that allow me to change my life for the better and educate other people as well on the effects of climate change. I also agree with the statement that one word could change the whole mood of the argument or conversation at hand and has a big impact on the intended audience. In order to educate the general population about the true effects of the climate crisis, I also have to agree that we have to come off as unbiased source of information otherwise people would not believe us as much because they would believe that we are biased and only giving one side of the story. By providing the honest sides of both opposing arguments, people should be able to form an educated opinion about the climate crisis and spread what they know to others.

Hi Carinna! I wanted to respond to your comment because I also feel the same way about this class. In the beginning I was worried that some of the content of this class was going to be difficult and hard to read. However, as the class is progressing I have come to enjoy doing the reading and watching the videos. I really enjoyed reading Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions. Not only because it gave me tips on how I can better communicate issues regarding the climate crisis but also because it was truly an interesting read. I feel like I have gained so much knowledge from this class and better self-awareness. What I really enjoyed about this reading was how easy it was to understand. I agree that the analogy about “uncle Pete” was a great way to explain the differences in opinions regarding the climate change. I also enjoyed how the reading then gave tips on how to address someone like uncle Pete. I also have someone in my life that reminds me of uncle Pete and I’ve always just avoided having any conversations about it because I know we are going to disagree. However, I feel like this was because my lack of real knowledge on the subject. I have always been a believer in protecting the planet and the importance around it but I never knew the science to back it up. As the reading pointed out the first step in communicating about the climate crisis is to know all the facts. Now that I have more knowledge about the subject, as well as accesses to resource to help validate my points I feel more confident to take on “uncle Pete”. 
<br><br>

 I agree that language use is really important. That why I personally felt like this reading was so great was because it used easy to understand language. When something is complex to understand I find that it can be discouraging. Equally when getting into conversations with someone that has all the information it can be overwhelming and discouraging to fully act on it. I really enjoyed watching Ken’s video introducing the reading. I feel as though Kens point about not initiating the conversation and waiting for others to come to you is really good advice. With Kens advice and having done the reading this week I feel as though I have a better understanding on how to communicate properly when discussing issues regarding the climate crisis. In the past I think I was guilty of being to aggressive and initiating conversation with others who were not interested. I understand now that communicating like that is not a good way to educate others and initiate change. Overall, I really enjoyed the reading this week and am looking forward to changing my communication behavior.




<br><hr>
Carinna, I agree with your statement about the usefulness of the reading, Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions, and also about Ken’s video comments on the reading. Most people who aren’t exposed to a class like ClimateCrisis 101 wouldn’t read something like Bending the Curve. This means that those climate activists who support the ideas in Bending the Curve won’t be able to translate climate ideas to others because of their lack of communication. I did like how upfront and logical this reading assignment was. I feel like everyone knows or knows of an Uncle Pete type character, someone who blatantly denies facts and denies climate change. In fact, I’m sure everyone knows Uncle Pete just not always in the context of climate change. I agree with what the book says about trying to make a message clear, concise, and easy to understand instead of something vast and complex. Scientists, and climate scientists in particular, have to understand that there are many people in the U.S. or even around the world who do not have an extensive background in climate science. This is why the message being sent needs to be clear and easy to follow, and in my own opinion I think the message is very clear and understandable: the earth is warming due to anthropogenic climate change.
 <br><br>
In addition to the book, I really enjoyed listening to Ken’s strategies and ideas of inviting people in to ask him about climate change. Instead of forcing the information and ideas down someone’s throat, one can simply wait and see if that person asks them why they vary their diet to eat less meat, or why they don’t own a car. To me this is a much smarter and friendlier approach then trying to force knowledge upon someone. I agree that if a vegan person were to go around flaunting their veganism and openly trying to convert people to their lifestyle choice, it would very much deter anyone from becoming vegan. However, if you can get people to observe your lifestyle choices on their own, then they are more interested in asking you about them and the inspiration behind them.




<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment on this reading and Ken’s video. To be honest, there are a huge amount of people just like “Uncle Pete”. They refused to learn about how serious global warming is and refused to acknowledge that people’s actions cause this problem. I can understand why they do not want to accept it because it may influence their benefit of doing another thing. For example, some politicians play the role of “Uncle Pete” because global warming is a long-term action and cannot show the outcome and advantage of doing this. The influence is not as significant as promoting the economy or something else. Some companies disagree with the fact that human beings cause global warming because it is a coal producer. Reducing the emissions of CO2 will let their profit become lower.
  <br><br>

Also, I totally agree with the significance of the word choice when people or writers try to persuade others or their audience. For example, if I talk about the problem of global warming with my younger brothers or my grandparents, I would not choose a considerable amount of academic words to explain how serious this problem is. Instead of it, I will use some vivid adjective words to show them why people need to focus on this problem. Giving them more examples and consequences that have already caused by global warming is more effective than telling them a massive amount of data and academic words. They cannot understand it and will cause them to feel sleepy; however, if I discuss this problem with my parents. I will find a lot of data and academic essays to support my idea. Showing them more academic sources will let them believe my thesis more. Because of this, I completely agree with the importance of the word choice of stating and persuading my opinion.




<br><hr>
I really found the “Uncle Pete” thing very interesting, as it is formed in a way that I had never thought about before. I think characterizing the group of climate change deniers with that extended metaphor of “Uncle Pete” is really well done and I like how you broke it down well. Like you, I really found the topic regarding cautious language interesting. I never really thought about how others may wrongly perceive what you have to say simply because of the use of a word that has been misinterpreted, such as Ken’s vegan example which you mentioned. I really like the way you phrased the best way to approach someone with your ideas: present yourself as an “enthusiast” rather than a “die-hard supporter”. That’s very interesting to think about: how simply changing words and taking a more subtle approach when speaking with somebody that doesn’t tend to agree with your views can be very effective.




<br><hr>

After reading the chapter, I felt very fortunate that I am taking a class where the purpose is to communicate to students about the climate crisis.  Before this class, I was not interested in the climate crisis at all.  I knew that it was important to do things like save water and switch to renewable energy sources, but I was not aware of how dire our planet’s situation is.
  <br><br>
If someone like me was told about the climate crisis outside of this class, I would just spend a couple minutes on google looking at the top search results for the climate crisis.  I would then promptly forget everything that I just looked up and continue living without any awareness of the fact that our planet is dying.  
  <br><br>
It is important to effectively communicate information about the climate crisis because many people are not aware of how badly our everyday actions are affecting the planet.  It also does not help that there are so many sources in the media that deny climate change for political purposes, making it even more difficult to convince people of the importance of combating climate change.  
  <br><br>
Reading the chapter made me realise how difficult it actually is to communicate the details of the climate crisis to others because there is so much information to convey, and we also have to consider the manner in which we communicate that information.  Because I am taking this class, I feel that there are so many things we need to tell people so that they know enough about the climate crisis.  But, giving people too much information just guarantees that they won’t remember anything and they will avoid discussing the topic in the future as they find it boring.




<br><hr>

Both this comment and the reading resonated fairly strongly with me.  I never knew this existed and would likely have never found out had it not been for the assignment.  Furthermore, I found it interesting how we all can think of an "Uncle Pete" we know.  I am fortunate enough to have a family that is aware and accepting of the climate crisis, but I know others who are not.  

  <br><br>

I feel as if the Uncle Pete metaphor is like a metaphor for the country as a whole.  Most of the time, Americans do not act unless it is in their best interests.  Furthermore, we have seen recently that all it takes to ruin a person or a movement is the dishonestly or misdeeds of an individual.  Thus, many of us are like Uncle Pete in some regards, even if not for climate change denial.  It is a easy path to follow and allows us to be complacent.  

  <br><br>

I also appreciated Ken's idea of not labeling oneself when talking to a group of skeptics.  They would inherently assume you had differing beliefs and it would be that much harder to make any progress.  This point is perhaps the most useful from the reading and is one I believe I could adopt in my everyday life.



<br><hr>
I agree that the way you present the information is a major factor when trying to give people the facts about climate change. I know some if not a lot of people are very skeptical about it because they don't have very reliable sources. Also their political affiliation most likely plays a role especially since a lot of conservative republicans in office have openly claimed climate change is a hoax. Communicating to skeptics can be difficult at times because they simply don't want to hear what you have to say. I think the reading provided great information to have an educated conversation and provide people with information that will help everyone in the long run




<br><hr>
Same as you, I really appreciate how Professor Hiltner is able to post such a variety of different literary and cinematic works regarding the issue of climate change. It definitely opened out new perspectives about how this issue was being presented in different unique dimensions. In this specific reading, I was also fascinated by the importance of language use when spreading the message to other people. For some people who lack the knowledge of climate change, it is very essential that you are presenting yourself as a reasonable, logical and patient source of information. Take, for example, if I am trying to explain this issue to another student here on campus, I would directly go on to use specific examples, scientific evidence and statistical measures to persuade on the urgency of climate change. However, if I am burdened to convince my little cousins about this issue, I would definitely use more easy words to describe the situation, instead of throwing complicated vocabularies that scare them away. I do resonate with this article, as I strongly believe that in order to get more people on board, the subtle way of how the information is being presented, delivered, and received is very crucial in the outcome, of whether they will truly resonate from the bottom of their hearts or not.




<br><hr>
You've brought up some relatable experiences. I personally tend to come across people who are willing and open to accept climate science, but either don't care, don't see the importance, or don't know how to address it. That's where my communication plays its biggest role.
  <br><br>

I really do agree with Ken that, often, being too blunt or upfront about the crisis can turn many people off. While that might seem frustrating, as we can only properly address the crisis when people understand the full severity of it, the reality is that a different approach is required to achieve this understanding. It's deeply uncomfortable for one to challenge and change their own beliefs and habits, as it was for me upon taking this class. I've been eating vegetarian for two weeks now, but that took me so much time to actually get myself to do. Changing people is very difficult, and it requires those people to feel a personal obligation to make those changes in order for them to occur. That's why we need to accommodate for people's existing tendencies in order to effectively create change in other people.
  <br><br>

When I go home for spring break, I'm planning to present the knowledge I've learned to my family in hopes of making lifestyle changes in our own house. I'm very glad that I read this chapter this week because it helps me in finding the best ways to communicate my knowledge to my family, who is progressive but not always ready to make large changes in our habits. 
  <br><br>

As far as my approach to this presentation, I'm going to play on the most direct effects of the crisis to my family (California wildfires, drought, warm temperatures in my city, etc.) so that they can relate to it. I'm going to incentivize change by acknowledging the personal benefits that our habits can bring about, such as a happier and healthier lifestyle, saving money, and philanthropy to the planet. Those are benefits that my family cares about, which is the important part. I want my family to realize the ways in which addressing climate change appeals to their values and gives them personal benefits. And I can do this through effective communication as detailed in this week's reading.




<br><hr>

Great comment. I agree with all the points you made. It is very cool to see this type of content from our very own UC system. This class, in general, has opened my eyes to what we really mean when we say "go green!" The readings and especially the films are very interesting reads. I agreed with you when you said that had it not been assigned reading you wouldn't have done them. I wouldn't even know something like "Bending the Curve" existed had it not been for this class. 
  <br><br>
Word choice is key when talking to people that may be on the opposite end of the spectrum in terms of climate change. It's true, sometimes all it takes for one "wrong" word for someone to completely tune out.



<br><hr>
Hi! I agree with you. I think this class is constantly giving me new resources and ideas that I've never thought of especially this week's readings. Like you said while yes it was forced upon us as an assignment it will be very useful information and a great tool to have plus I found it really interesting to read. I have also had some frustrating conversations with my family members that don't really seem to lead to any sort of good ending or common ground and I think this reading has helped me understand that the steps I take in communication could change this. One of which is the language I use. Ken's example of the word "vegan" shows this. I really liked how Ken addresses the fact that you oftentimes need to wait until the person you are talking to is ready. If you don't you will likely be telling them something they don't want to hear and they will let it go in one hear and out the other. I have been on both sides of this and I know it never accomplishes anything.




<br><hr>
I totally agree with you. These films and readings have dramatically influenced the way I think about climate change and when I learn about things that I find intriguing, I tend to blab on about it to my friends. Although with climate change, my friends get fired up about it too, but they still aren't on the same level (erm, that sounds snobby) and aren't ready for the amount of information that I want to spew at them. So I am glad this information is out there, so when I am trying to refute someone's opinions, I can do it in a way that isn't overbearing and doesn’t seem completely radical to them. I was fond of the Uncle Pete character but the comparison to the medical community stuck with me. My brain had an “ahah” moment and it all seemed to click. I think this comparison can be useful when challenging the views of climate skeptics.
  <br><br>


I have been vegetarian for a few years due to health concerns, not exactly for the climate but now that I am more informed on this issue, I am adding “because I want to be mindful of the climate” to my reasoning. I have always thought about going vegan, but I am a big lover of dairy. More and more, being vegetarian is not a surprise to a lot of folks. They are either vegetarian too or it is common amongst the people they know. I never get too many questions, but veganism has been completely demonized. It can be seen as bougie and “impossible” to some people, so whenever someone brings it up or I say something about wanting to become vegan, they stop listening. LOL. I never take it personal, but it just reminds me that we need to find other ways to inform others without always being in activist mode. People seem to like it (and so do I) when people are more subtle—it drives me to understand more.




<br><hr>
I also found this reading to be a super useful tool and something that I should have read a few weeks ago. One night at the library, I watching Cowspiracy and getting really frustrated while watching it. I turned to a friend who was sitting next to me and started to rant about how he should stop eating beef. At first, the discussion was harmless, but it turned into an aggressive, accusatory mess that I completely regret, because it only made him not want to do what I was asking of him. Both this reading, and Ken's video stress that if I actually wanted him to assess his own eating habits, I shouldn't have gotten to be so extreme in my words and views. I violated all the guidelines put forth in the reading: I used harsh language, I did not have all the facts, I didn't use applicable metaphors, and I definitely rambled on a tangent, not really saying much towards the end. I found these things really helpful, not just for talking about climate, but in general. I find myself giving my opinion or views without being fully informed about what I'm talking about, which makes people respect me less in group discussions sometimes. 
  <br><br>


Like a lot of people in this thread, I have an immense respect for Ken. It takes great restraint in holding yourself to a different, personal set of standards and not comparing yourself to others to prove your moral worth. It's something that I think comes with great practice and maturity -- the ability to focus on being content with your actions before speaking out, and choosing to speak out at the right times to be the most effective communicator. I'd definitely like to try again with this friend of mine to see if he'd be more willing to listen to what I have to say next time around.

I agree with your comment. The use of a figure such as Uncle Pete was a great way to get the messages across. On thing from Ken's video that I found very interesting was when he talked about the way he lives his life, and how he doesn't tell people about it unless they ask. I think timing is very key to getting more people to join the fight against the climate crisis. I have found myself explaining to friends why I decided to change a couple things about my diet and it definitely sparks conversation. Though I didn't go to a completely plant based diet, things like avoiding beef and turning to healthier options is something that I found to be very easy.




<br><hr>
As do many other people, I agree with your whole comment completely. I believe I learned a lot about global climate change happening all around the world. In the past, I thought reading and watching films like this is a kind of wasting time. However, my world view has been changed after attending this class. I no longer consider these books and videos as a waste of time but excellent opportunities to get to know and contribute something to save our planet. The reading this week is also a great one and helps me understand what else I can do in order to help our home. As a figure in the reading shows, "The destiny of the planet is in our hands", my opinion is well presented by this figure.

I love your comment and can also relate to them personally. I was so pleased after I watched the introduction video by Ken, that the reading was all about communication and communication of the climate crisis. I'm already very bad at communication in general, and when I'm trying to explain climate change or my choices to eat largely plant-based I get so frustrated and feel hopeless that I can't communicate or even mores, convince others of the gravity of the climate crisis. I chose to be vegan last year and since then have not been perfect, but I really do try my best. I've only been buying plant-based groceries but every so often I'' have a slice of pizza at a party or go to in n out with all my friends. It's really embarrassing when people ask me why I'm eating animal products or say oh I thought you were vegan. But what I learned through Summerville's chapter I read this week, is that it's ok to not be purely and perfectly vegan AND these conversations are opportunities to open up about why I chose to become vegan in the first place, which is the climate crisis. I can explain how I not only value eating plant-based, but buying local, organic produce and making conscious decisions like Ken's example of a beef burger compared to a turkey burger compared to lentils. I can also use this to explain to my friends that making changes for our future and the future of the planet do not always have to be extreme and fool-proof. They too can take a first step and start on their own path to climate-friendly and low emissions eating!

I enjoyed the content that this comment held. This class has exposed me to a lot of material and topics that I knew about but never explored. Personally, Ive been a lot more aware of the world around me and the issue of the climate crisis. On top of that, I have been more proactive about spreading the urgency of the issue at hand. On a grand societal scale, all this information that I was exposed to in this class is virtually almost accessible to anyone. With that said, the facts are out there but the spread of information and misinformation is halting the overall outreach. I really like how Carinna brought up language use. The way in which we say things and the type of diction we utilize when saying these things do have an underestimated importance. Especially in the world we live in today, it is extremely easy to twist an entire argument with the misuse of a single word. When engaging an audience who may not be well informed or well educated about the topic at hand; you as the teacher, have to say things in a way that are simple, direct, and effective all at the same time. Looking at the entire video, the key points expressed in this video really do a good job at highlighting the importance of communication and the monumental importance communication can have.

I totally agree with you that this week’s reading provides us with great tools that we can use to effectively spread awareness about the climate crisis. As a left leaning person with a love for the environment born into a very conservative family, it can be difficult (almost impossible at times) to even bring up topics such as climate change in my home. After reading this article, I realize it may be because I have gone about bringing up this issue/defending it in the complete wrong way! I often try to spew out as many facts and intelligent sounding statements as possible, which I now realize can work against me and  only confuses the people I’m communicating with and angers them further. Because of this, I also found the point about language use to be most interesting and helpful. As Hiltner said, certain words can act as triggers for people and cause them to become completely disinterested, thus thwarting your own plan to get your point across and educate your audience. The reading and Ken’s comments about it have provided us with the means for proper communication about sensitive issues such as the climate crisis and I hope that I can put these to use in the near future.

Yes, I agree. It is a good way to introduce the concept to others or even persuade them to try it. The curiosity is the most important characteristic of human beings. The curiosity can be dangerous when it be taken advantage for bad purpose. However, it is good to use curiosity to spread the concept of protecting the environment. Step by step is also a good strategy to use. Most people can not transfer from omnivore to vegan rapidly. Thus, the process is important. The great communicating strategy can spread the idea widely. When more people have an environment-protecting lifestyle, they will influence the people around them. It will be a virtuous cycle. 

  <br><br>

Even people may be influenced by others, human desire is still hard to be changed. People who have less material desire will be easier persuaded, or even do the environment-protecting lifestyle by themself. However, those people normally are well-educated and have the faith which metaphysically. Those people only are a small percent of the population. They may not make big difference.



<br><hr>
I also share the exact same sentiment in regards to Ken “forcing” us to read and watch material that we more often than not, not even touch, let alone read and think about. I think it’s great and I love reading almost all of the material he requires of us. It sometimes makes me think about the argument from a different perspective or makes me consider factors, issues, causes, etc that I wouldn’t normally consider. It’s invaluable to me and to the class as a whole. It also makes it more interesting in my opinion. 
  <br><br>
I also really liked the part about “Uncle Pete” because it makes it more relatable to many of us. Most of us have one or two family members that are so stubborn in their way of thinking politically that it’s hard to have conversations unless you agree with them. It’s also quite sobering to hear that other people have these same types of people in their families because it makes us feel like we’re not alone. I don’t like that our “Uncle Petes” are so against new information, or that they believe so heavily in conspiracies but there’s something relatable in knowing other people deal with this, and I thought it was a great idea for them to include this example as a way of relating to us.




<br><hr>

I completely agree with what you said. The readings in Climate Crisis 101 have offered us something we have never read before, like Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions. I believe many people in our society, especially the politicians, are like "Uncle Pete" - stubborn and skeptical about the climate crisis. I found it ridiculous to see politicians' viewpoints about climate change and, while I understood they were mistaken, I didn't really understand the full extent of their behavior and how those who truly understand climate change actually feel over these deniers. Luckily, this course has increased our environmental consciousness. I think the education we received can help us become more environmentally active, and there will be fewer people like "Uncle Pete" in our generation.



<br><hr>
I agree with you in that if it wasn’t a mandatory assignment to be reading these books/articles, I most likely wouldn’t have read any of them either. The chapter did a good job in using the metaphor of “Uncle Pete” in order to portray the average climate change denier. “Uncle Pete” is described as someone who believes every claim that skeptics use to disprove global warming. He is someone who is difficult to speak to when it comes to the topic of climate change because he is stubborn and thinks what he knows is correct. As Ken states, it is important to know how to communicate the topic of climate change to those around you. Like he said, stating that you are vegan or vegetarian seems to kill the mood when going out to eat with your friends. You need to learn how to make them interested in the subject and actually want to learn what you are practicing and why you do it rather than just sharing information that they may pay little attention to since they won’t be very interested in learning.




<br><hr>

I completely agree with your comment about how this class has exposed you to a wide range of media concerning climate change. I would even say that because of this class I have consumed more of a variety of material (in terms of readings and films) than I have encountered in previous ES classes I've taken. This was a bit unexpected for me, but I'm grateful for the access to media revolving around climate change that Ken has granted us. On a less positive note, I also resonate with "Uncle Pete" being present in your own family members. Many of my family members are apathetic to anthropogenic climate change, but there are a view who flat out refuse to believe that it is an actual issue. The chapter of "Communicating Climate Change Science" we were assigned made me believe there is still hope in getting through to them by effective communication.



<br><hr>

I really relate to the idea of not being prepared for the weird, divergent arguments that the Uncle Petes of the world throw at you. I cannot count the number of times I haven't been able to refute a bad argument because simply saying "that isn't true" or "that is a hoax" is the exact same argument that deniers give. I think that throughout my education here at UCSB, getting a degree in ES has definitely helped to facilitate convincing Uncle Petes, but this reading provides me with a sense of calm. I think this logical and systematic approach, and not only being able to identify but have logical counter arguments prepared beforehand, is what makes facing these people seem less nerve wracking. 
  <br><br>
I think that being able to effectively communicate is going to be a huge necessity in bringing about change. This reading identifies the problems that can occur in communicating: scientists using technical jargon that the general public misinterprets or do not have the vocabulary to understand. I also enjoyed how Ken decided to illustrate the importance of word choice when communicating through a personal story about his veganism. I think that understanding the ways in which your audience will perceive your message is imperative to being able to communicate effectively. Another thing that the reading does that I appreciate is explain how analogies can be effective– especially when they are used thoughtfully and aimed towards an audience that will receive them well. If an Uncle Pete you are talking to loves baseball, and you are aware of that, then the baseball/steroids analogy would probably be enjoyed and better understood.



<br><hr>

I complete agree, the Uncle Pete character is masterfully done, and it's easy to project our own family or friends that continue to deny the growing crisis. It can be so frustrating trying to explain the realities of the situation only to be met with a response that doesn't really make sense, and often times a result of political propaganda as you mentioned. This issue shouldn't be a partisan one at all- this is a matter of planetary life and death, and the president won't even concede that there's an issue at all. While I agree that the steps Sommerville offered to go about discussing this topic are useful, and I will be using them in the future, I can't imagine sitting down with someone like Don*ld Tr*mp and successfully using these  suggestions to convince him of what's really happening on our planet. If they won't believe scientists, who are meant to be trusted sources of information, I can't imagine getting them to believe that my words are any more true, especially if that person is an older family member to peer who thinks their age comes with infinite wisdom. 
  <br><br>


I have faith that everybody can understand the truth and alter their lives to save the Earth, and I believe we will one day too. I know that it will be our generation who evokes this change with conversations and rallies utilizing these strategies to spread the correct information to do so, but it's still scary to think that the people who refuse to believe the truth might actually win, and this rhetoric might fail to save our species. All we can do is continue to speak up and do our part to fight for our future.



<br><hr>
I think you’ve got the right idea regarding the complicated nature of talking about climate change with people like “Uncle Pete.” It is a sensitive topic wrapped up in ideological belief, academic understanding, political association, value systems, traditions and so much more. Therefore, it can be difficult to find the common ground with someone who has such a different viewpoint than yourself. However, I would be careful with writing off all climate skeptics as “stubborn, conservative, science-doubting” people because the issue is much more complex than that. It is not appropriate to blame individuals for what they do or do not believe; rather, consider the systemic and social pressures which led the individual to have the thoughts and values they have. Just like how many perpetrators of sociopathic crimes have been pressured by difficult life situations and neglected by mainstream society, climate deniers are also victims of a flawed society. They are not flawed individuals. Many climate deniers simply, and even climate activists, just regurgitate arguments that they’ve heard from politicians they trust and from other people with similar values. They most likely are not telling you their own original ideas and beliefs about the climate and the broader world system. So instead of attacking these arguments, that aren’t even theirs to begin with, I believe it would be more effective to try to understand what they really think, not the words they’ve memorized and recycled.


<br><hr>

I really agree with the points you made. I have gotten plenty of useful resources from this course, but this week’s reading is the most practical. Before taking Professor Ken’s course, I am aware about some facts or human activities causing the climate crisis, but I have no idea about how to convince others to act on it. The book, “Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions,” and the video has proposed methods to raise the awareness about the climate crisis. I also agree that language use is really important, and the goal is to get the audience feel that you are a reliable source of information.



<br><hr>

I agree, Ken is extremely enthusiastic, passionate and optimistic for the environment. I truly appreciate his dedication on educating the younger generation on the issues of climate change and how we individuals could positively contribute to saving the planet. Before taking any of Ken’s classes, climate change honestly did not really cross my mind. I knew a broad generalization of what climate change consists of but I did not think of all the small things, such as minimalistic lifestyle, less air travel and even going vegetarian for at least once a week could make a major difference in the long run. Ever since taking Kens class,  attending lectures, watching all of these documentaries, and reading scientific articles has changed my whole perspective on the world. It has truly altered my mindset and made me into a completely different person. I realize that I look at the things I do, buy, and eat in a completely different way. 
  <br><br>
I also completely relate to your comment because I would have never thought to read such an article as well if it was not forced as an assignment but I, too, am extremely grateful that I had the opportunity to read it. Not only did this film expose the myths of climate change deniers, the points made in this article are entirely effective by presenting clear solutions and explanations. I was completely unaware of “Climatarianism '' and how individuals tend to demonize environmentally friendly minds. Individuals tend to see an attack/threat to their personal freedom of choice when this article is just acknowledging the harmful choices that individuals tend to make in their daily life. Communication and informing others Is an extremely important aspect when dealing with the topic of the climate crisis. Word choice, investigation and factual data are all significant factors when presenting information to your audiences and trying to intrigue their interest in trying to save the planet. The methods that are mentioned in the reading, such as Stories, Metaphors, Language and Solutions, could potentially make a huge difference when explaining the topic of climate issues. The reference to “Uncle Pete '' was unwittingly clever  because it is a very realistic situation since everyone knows some sort of ‘Uncle Pete’ that disregards climate change because he does not believe in it. Overall, Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions was a very fun, informative and interesting reading to read.

I am also very glad that I took this class because of the sheer amount of different kinds of material that Ken exposes us to. Before I took this class, I always knew that the climate crisis was an issue but I had no idea to what extent and I didn’t even have the slightest idea on how to start fixing the issue. I noticed Ken definitely uses the methods that he mentioned in this video. When I started English 22,  I just selected a random class that my orientation leader recommended. Even though the class wasn’t about the climate crisis, Ken still made sure to interject a lot of facts and information about the topic. He did this firmly but not so aggressively as to make me lose interest and tune him out. Even though I had no idea what Eng 22 was about, it ended up beginning my favorite class because of how Ken sparked my interest in the environmental crisis. As a result, I joined his climatete crisis class and the environmental movement gained another loyal follower. Even in the class now,  I feel like Ken is still employing the same methods. He is not throwing everything at us at once, saving the more extreme or drastic situations for later. He slowly piques our interest and builds us up so that these drastic suggestions do to seem as extreme as they used to. By reading “Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions,” and listening to Ken’s strategies, I feel that I have learned a lot of strategies to how to talk to “uncle Pete.”



<br><hr>

I like the this week’s reading because it explains how to effectively communicate the issue of climate change. Some people are like Uncle Pete, they just keep denying facts and misguiding others. Some people are aware of some of the climate issues, but not fully, so they want to pretend they know it all. This reading encourages us to admit when we are unaware on a topic, and to refute the claims made by climate deniers. I liked when the author said that preparing well is the first step to communicating well. I totally agree with it, because not only for climate issues, but also for many other topics in our daily life, the way to communicate is very important, especially when we meet Uncle Pete. How to communicate with Uncle Pete in a simple but convincing way is what we are aiming to.



<br><hr>
I really agree with your comment. As you mentioned, You feel like you will not read through such materials if it is not an assignment, I think it also applies to most people in this class. This class brought a lot of new materials that I have never heard of before. You said the use of language will highly influence the understanding of the audience. I can really share the same feeling because I am an international student. I had a hard time reading through the class materials when I just came here. Back to the topic, the rhetorical devices and language styles are really important for environment literature. How to make people understand the severity of the issue without over-estimating it is also crucial. In my writing class, I searched one journal article written by Ken. It is about how the European authors explain the reason for terrible air pollution at London during the 16th century. To make the books more popular or make the audience comfortable, the authors blame the industry for terrible air quality. In fact, it is the coal burnt for the residence that caused air pollution. Also, making an objective argument is also crucial. Some authors are real alarmists, and their arguments about the environment only make people feel worse without actually encouraging the audience.




<br><hr>

Before this class, I thought that the most important way to communicate the dangers of climate change was through facts and evidence. However, like you, I came to realize that the most important aspect of convincing people to believe in the effects of climate change is the language you use. I also really enjoyed this week's reading because it explained how some people (like Uncle Pete) reject the idea of climate change because they'd rather believe in climate "facts" that suit their own rhetoric. I've come across many people like Uncle Pete on various social media, and the reading really did help me realize how I can communicate better to the climate deniers without sounding like an extremist.



<br><hr>

I agree the way topics are presented and talked have a major impact on how people react to the information. In a time where people are exposed to a lot of information over social media, it is important to make a important information stand out and be very easy to understand. I agree that its important to be less forceful in getting people who are not as aware of the climate crisis to understand what is going on in order to have people get the importance and not feel as they are being forced to have the same points of view as perhaps an alarmist.



<br><hr>
I agree with what you said. "Communicating Climate Change Science"  emphasizes the importance of communication. The way the passage explains the different ways that people should communicate about this issue proves to be an effective way to spread awareness. This is important as education is the most effective way to fight against climate crisis. The manner that Somerville wrote the passage allows anyone to be able to explain concisely the severity of the issue and its roots through the effective metaphors that it lists. I find that it is important to not criticize climate deniers as the main priority now is to inform others instead of shame them to join the cause. It is much more effective to provide unbiased and useful information to curious people rather than immediately shut them down because of their ignorance.




<br><hr>

I feel you. I am a person who would not read anything about climate crisis unless I was assigned to do. Similarly, I am also glad that I took this class because it simply shows how dire the circumstance is. My family, luckily, believes in science and are aware that climate crisis is here, so at least there is no "Uncle Pete" in regards of climate crisis. However, I do understand how language is important in persuading people around us to join our move. I have a friend who is a rock music fan especially towards those indie bands with less popularity. Everytime we meet he will drag some of us to persuade how great the band is and join him in supporting for the band. I admire his passion yet can never be convinced to join him because I was simply scared.



<br><hr>
Thoroughly enjoyed reading through your response. I feel like you did a grand job here and I have to say that my most lasting impression of your comment here is how you dived into the topic of concerning language use, a very important part of conventions and writing for maximum persuasive effect. Everything which you analyzed about this from this video and the reading was very well put, as I wholeheartedly agree that the simplest wording change, can differentiate an argument’s strength. Sommerville’s reading is truly the basic outline of how to communicate in the best methods using the best strategies of tactics when it comes down to discussion of climate change, a rather more controversial and sensitive topic for many. I appreciate that you brought in some personal connections and examples, as I was able to heavily relate back to media portrifications throughout my life that climate change has often been argued in my time as just something the government is using as leverage for more private and control over us. This indeed, has come across as an argument during the past few years, but after having been consistently educated about the climate crisis since an early age, these other arguments do little to faze me in changing my mind that something should be done. Education here, seems key, and education about the way we talk, eloquently and using the right terminology when addressing climate change with other groups, is essential in differentiating between a strong persuasive statement and one that lacks anything convincing. Educating people also means earning their trust as a source of information and credibility. This week’s reading informed the necessary steps in communication to take in order to engage with people, particularly about the climate change situation. You state it best here how when engaging with people who are less informed about our current climate crisis, presenting yourself as a die-hard supporter of taking climate action can understandably scare them off, as would using too much technical jargon or other such turn-offs in language that would otherwise guide people and our planet to safety later down the road.




<br><hr>

I also appreciate how this class exposes me to a wide range of literary and cinematic pieces regarding climate change. I enrolled in this class to learn more about the climate crisis because I did not know that much about climate change, even though this class does not fulfill any general education requirements for me. I can also certainly say that I would not read anything regarding the climate crisis if it was not assigned to me if I did not take this class. However, I will try to read more books and articles regarding the climate change from now on to stay more updated and gain more information, especially to spread knowledge about the urgency of the climate crisis. I also agree how it is a useful tool to learn how to convince the "Uncle Pete" in our life in order to make a difference in the world and help resolve the climate crisis one step at a time. It is interesting to me how the way we phrase things could either capture the intended audience's attention or completely disinterest them. Like you and Ken mentioned, the use of one wrong word can lose a person's attention, highlighting the importance of diction and syntax. Therefore, I appreciate books like "Communicating the Climate Crisis" that teaches us to communicate better.



<br><hr>

• The reading really made it clear just how critical effective communication is for addressing the climate crisis. As Ken points out, merely advertising environmentally-conscious lifestyle choices such as veganism or vegetarianism usually does not spur people to action; if anything, it turns them away from it. Instead, we must carefully account for the widespread misunderstanding and ignorance around these issues in our approach, and avoid framing topics such as veganism in a way that unintentionally criticizes people’s own lifestyles as morally or environmentally irresponsible. Bending The Curve compares climate change science to medical science: medical science has become respected and, for the most part, trusted by the public, while climate change science is still just beginning to reach the same level of acceptance. One example of effective communication the book uses is metaphors; since, for many people, climate change science may be a foreign concept, comparing it to more universally shared knowledge/ideas may be helpful.



<br><hr>
I totally agree with you. I like what ken taught to us and his endless passion for the environment.  What is more, I agree with the Uncle Pete" who is a skeptical and refuses to accept the scientific truth of climate change. It is true that sometimes the people around us will have some different or even some wrong understanding of something about the environment. But it is not false and as the student who has the Engl23 this quarter. As long as someone wants to know or have some puzzles towards the perspectives on the environment. Then that will be our obligation to explain the concepts or any other scientific definitions to them thoroughly.





<br><hr>

I completely agree that this class exposes us to so many important texts, films, and other pieces of media that I might have never come across or took the time to study. I also agree that this reading, “Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions,” is a useful tool for people who are ready to spread awareness about the climate disaster. Many of us have encountered an Uncle Pete character in our own lives: someone who claims climate scientists are dishonest or incompetent and repeats myths about climate science. I was not very educated on the subject before this class, so I wouldn’t pick a fight with Uncle Pete but rather disagree quietly. Now I have a plentitude of facts and information I want to passionately share with everyone! I am ready to spread awareness about this disaster and have gained a desire to combat the Uncle Pete’s of the world. But this article is important because it teaches us how to share information in the most effective way possible, rather than scaring people off or intimidating them with academic language and large amounts of information. It teaches us how to reason even with the most extreme climate deniers like Uncle Pete. 
  <br><br>

One tip the reading includes is that facts matter. There are proven, concrete facts about climate change and using these can create a stronger argument. Like you mentioned, language is crucial. The article describes things like how using scientific jargon can confuse people and how burying the lead is only hurting your argument. Ken also used the example of how calling himself a climatarian initiates a conversation and sparks interests in climatarian options whereas being “vegan” is attributed to a feeling of moral superiority and presents people with only a scary either/or option. Ken also says he doesn’t advertise his climate conscious lifestyle but waits until people are ready to hear about his choices. It was interesting to hear that just by living in a climate conscious manner, you might inspire others to live with the environment in mind. You don’t have to overwhelm others with facts, sometimes it works better to focus on your own choices and that alone could attract others to your kind of lifestyle. I also liked the reading’s tip about including information on solutions so that you aren’t just preaching hopelessness. No one wants to hear that our planet is doomed. 
  <br><br>

Unfortunately, the climate crisis has become a political issue when it has nothing to do with politics or ideology. Readings like this one are important for communicating correct information about climate change to others without starting a political debate or having what you say be completely shut down due to politics.





<br><hr>

I agree with you. The exposure to this piece of literature is something I would probably never had read in another class. But, because it comes from Ken and this class makes you want to learn more the readings and films we are given as assignments have become something I look forward to. I am thankful to Ken for this exposure of course because I too would never have read something like "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions". The analogy of "Uncle Pete" also really stuck with me. I think we all have that relative that scuffs at you as a response to telling them you are taking a class about climate change. The most frustrating thing about it is its their generation fault that we are in this position and on top of that they can't even acknowledge it? It gets offensive at that point. How can we make systematic change when entire generations continue to right us off and not take us serious? I know there will always be people like this in my life but this reading validated those feelings. Climate skeptics and their counterarguments aren't going anywhere but neither will we.

When reading Chapter 8 from "Communicating Climate Change Science", I really enjoyed the reading. However, what I enjoyed more was Hiltner talking about his experiences with being vegan and aware of the emerging extreme climate crisis. He claimed himself not as a climate Crisis first and not as vegan first when his friends asked him. We all have that 'uncle Pete' in our lives and the author set out guidelines about how to perfectly rebut and communicate with Pete how he is wrong without getting into an argument. I have an "Uncle Pete" in my life and I find it extremely difficult and frustrating to have a conversation with them. It is not worth the time or energy to try and convince them to understand environmentalism and the urgency of the climate crisis, because it simply won’t have that much of an effect on solving issues.


<br><hr>
I couldn't agree with your comment more. I have some friends or family like this, but it is very difficult to communicate with them.The reason is that I don't have any persuasion on my own, so I decided to do something to influence them from myself, to let them see my change, and my influence on the people around me.I don't have to give up meat. I can choose to eat less high-emission meat and never waste any food.I believe this will change my friends and family.

This week’s reading was probably my favorite we have had thus far. I recently went home for the long weekend and was at a family dinner with my extended family when they asked about my classes this quarter. I exclaimed that I loved my climate change class and began to talk about the experience I have had as a student in this class. I emphasized lots of the new information I have learned and the lifestyle changes my close family and I have had to decrease our own carbon footprint. My cousin who is twenty three years old began to argue with me regarding the realness of climate change and if climate change was truly caused by human actions. His stance on climate change shocked me. Throughout the course almost every comment of mine relates to the lack of education our society has and how I believe that this lack of education greatly contributes to the problem. Therefore, I used this as an opportunity to educate him as well as everyone at the table about climate change using statistics and doing my best to combat his points that he was making. I really wish that I had done this week's reading prior to our conversation. The points that are made are effective to be successful and graceful in most arguments but specifically works excellently with climate change. I really admire that the significance of preparation is highlighted and the emphasis on using clear simple messages. Also considering one’s audience and what they care most about is something that would make or break the way someone interprets your comments. I also greatly appreciate that the chapter highlighted the importance of using a personal story. Not only is it engaging but it allows the other person to be able to resonate with your viewpoint and see climate change as more than just a statistic. Using a metaphor is not something I had previously considered, but now am aware of its great potential. It not only makes the great complex issue that is climate change much simpler, but is an easy way to remember and facilitate people to continue to think about climate change. Language is also greatly significant due to the issue that can occur when communicating between scientists and the average person. Addressing this in the chapter, since it is something that I would probably not though of on my own, allowed me to see the importance of framing an issue towards the audience you are attempting to reach. Lastly, solutions is possibly the most important part of the way we must talk about climate change. If we were to just present issues with no way to escape the problems we list, no one would want to listen to us. I have no doubt that all of these factors in combination with one another would be an incredible way to compose a convincing, accurate and successful conversation regarding climate change.

I also really liked this week's reading because I have always felt that communicating the facts about climate change has been pretty difficult to do and is something that has to be done in a specific way. While I personally have not had to try to convince others that climate change is human caused and is an extremely urgent issue because most people I know agree  with me on that, I have had to explain to them things that they could be doing  that  would help reduce their carbon footprint. Most people I know, like my friends for example, know that climate change is here and it is bad, but still aren’t taking any steps to do what they can individually to help. I think this article gives a lot of good strategies about how to communicate to climate deniers about climate change, but unfortunately it doesn't include much about how to communicate to people like my friends who see it as an issue, but aren’t making any personal lifestyle changes. I have found it hard to try and convince them that making lifestyle changes,  like changing  your diet, consuming less stuff, etc can be extremely beneficial to the environment because they all feel that just  them changing the way they live won't really do anything because there are so many people on the planet not changing. This is frustrating to hear because making a lifestyle change to your own individual life will also influence people around you. When I started going to school here I became more informed and aware of what I could be individually  doing to help the climate crisis and I  made changes to my diet and level of  consumption. After doing this, my dad actually also changed his diet and started to become more interested and invested in what he could do to help. People can influence other people through communication and information. I appreciated this article because it presented scenarios that might come up in a conversation about climate change and how to address those scenarios in a way that won’t send people into deeper denial. 
   <br><br>
I also appreciated the idea in the reading about relating the climate crisis to something personal in the individual's life. Climate change is in some way related to everything about this planet. Nothing here would exist without the actual Earth, so if the earth is destroyed, everything  on it will also be destroyed. There is nothing that will go unaffected, so everyone on this planet has something they care about and love,  whether  that be family, friends, the outdoors, or literally anything else. Explaining to these people that life will be completely altered will help them see  and feel emotionally the impact that this crisis could have on their lives which will hopefully influence them to make change.

I also enjoyed this week’s reading because it tackles the one issue I have always struggled with in articulating my thoughts about the climate crisis to my family and friends: communicating. Even beyond the issue of climate change, I have always struggled with communicating effectively with the people in life, who no matter what I say; never seem to get it. But after reading Bending the Curve, I realized that the way I have been communicating might not be as effective as I had hoped and now, I need to make that change. As you mentioned, the emphasis on presenting clear simple messages is crucial when communicating. I can now understand why some of my family members can get kind of turned off when I go on ranting and possibly losing sight of the point I am trying to get across. Coming from someone who is a humanities major, I also tune out of a conversation when someone in STEM starts to use all of these scientific and technical jargon that I would not understand unless I too was educated in that field. So next time I try to talk to people about an issue such as climate change, I will make sure to think about what the book states, “Use simple clear messages, repeated often, by a variety of trusted messengers.” I also found the method of metaphors quite interesting as I never really thought of that as a way to communicate difficult topics such as climate change. Using metaphors makes understanding complex issues much easier to understand and even more approachable. Also, I too believe addressing solutions is crucial to effectively communicate. When discussing all the horrors of the climate crisis, it could be very easy for someone to just shut down and not want to hear anymore. But by offering solutions to the climate crisis, it makes discussing the issue more approachable and offers a sign of hope that change can happen-if we act.

I think it's awesome that you got use the material you learned in this course to educate those around you. I was also very enthusiastic about the reading this week. Because the climate crisis is such a dire issue, it's important to communicate messages in the most effective way possible. Especially as a communication studies major, I felt really connected with the points made in the article. For starters, I loved the ideas of using stories and metaphors. By using methods like this, the crisis is easier explained. I feel like many people think about the climate crisis in complex terms, and do not even attempt to understand what's going on. The reality is that it in fact is not that complex, the facts are made upfront and clear. The planet is warming at accelerated speeds and this is because of humans. Using metaphors allows people to put things into perspective, and gives them more chances to understand the crisis. 
   <br><br>

I also thought it was important that language was discussed. Before taking this course I was worried I would not understand the material because I was not well versed in the scientific terms used to describe the crisis. However, Ken ( along with all the readings) explain the problems in such a clear and understandable way. Using familiar vocabulary, jargon, and units of measurement allows a whole range of people to comprehend the messages being made. 
   <br><br>

In addressing Ken's video, I can see how being a climaterien is an effective way of reducing your carbon footprint. While I myself am largely plant based, I think climaterianism is a good alternative for someone who does not want to give up meat. This is a smart way to make positive decisions that keep the planet in mind and avoid supporting harmful industries.

I have always struggled when it came to communicating about the climate crisis to my friends and family. I always wondered, how can I take what I have learned in this class and effectively communicate? Reading your comment about how you wish you have done this week's reading prior to the conversation you had with your family, made me realize the ways and opportunities that I have to communicate with those around me, including my family and my friends. There are many people who are close to me that still do not know about the climate crisis and the way human actions play a role. Similar to your situation in facing disagreement from your cousin about the climate crisis, I feel that I will also encounter that with my own family members. 
   <br><br>
Yet, there is a side to me that feels that after having this information and tips from the reading, I can effectively communicate with my family about the climate crisis, even if they do disagree with what I have to say. As you noted, this week's reading made it clear that to successfully communicate with others, you need to know your audience, know the issue, and present the message clearly. We just need to take our knowledge and piece it together in order to educate the public. Moreover, I agree with you, the education that the world is missing about the climate crisis plays a big role in the lack of action, and in order to change this we need to communicate and carry the message of saving our planet.

I have had similar experiences as the comment above mentions, in which there are multiple times that I have expressed to my family or even friends about this course and how it relates to either what we were talking about or doing, and was able to spread my knowledge to them. Informing them about the climate crisis and how horrible it is getting that it's s becoming alarming, they were all surprised yet concerned at the same time They usually are surprised at how bad it is and how much it can actually affect our lives and also concerned at the fact that so many people lack knowledge in this area and are not aware of the climate crisis. This week reading I think is very beneficial to anyone who reads it because more incidents like I mentioned I'm sure will come and maybe in the future, my family or friends might have opposing views, and now with help of this reading, I will know how to approach the situation in the best way possible and hopefully leave a positive impact on that person that may make them think twice and hopefully change their view.

I am glad you were able to have a wonderful and civil discussion with your family about climate change! Being able to teach and share to people the importance of trying to fix climate change is the first big step for us to move forward and get to where we need to be in carbon emissions. I agree that this reading is so helpful in terms of talking to people about climate change, and I wish I discovered this book way before whenever I had my discussions with my own "Uncle Pete". With my own Uncle Pete, we got into some heavy and heated arguments about the effects of climate change and what we need to do to solve it. Like your cousin, my own Uncle Pete had some shocking ideas of what climate change is and how it is not a "big deal". Sadly, all of my conversations with him turned political, as I tried to tell him our capitalistic society needs to change for us to fix climate change while he exclaimed that my socialist ideals were towards communism. If I had found this reading sooner, I would've taken a less hasty approach and had more of a civil discussion instead of judgement.
   <br><br>
I also agree that the highlight of a personal story is REALLY effective in terms of informing people about the dangers of climate change. I use this section all the time with my stories about the Paradise fire and the farming problems I have back in my home town. If the effects of climate change can be seen as too broad, then using personal stories and specific details is a good way to go to explain to someone that this hurts EVERYONE. This reading made it a really easy guide for us to use to make civil conversations with people and our own Uncle Petes, because science IS difficult to understand at times. But if we make the topic of climate change easy and fun to learn, then we can fix the lack of education about climate change. By doing this, we will definitely be on the right path on changing our world for the better.

I think your comment is a perfect example of why I loved the discussion of encounters with individuals similar to Uncle Pete because it’s true that there are plenty of people like Uncle Pete all around us. What I appreciated from the reading is how it touched upon why people would be deniers of climate change. For example, they may not even believe it’s a science issue, but something completely unrelated to the field. Rather, they are paranoid that it’s a tactic in politics / within the government to gain more control and use harsher regulations to their benefit. This is greatly untrue, as we know, since the government allows multi-national corporations to continue to profit off their greenhouse gas emissions. The government does not want to lose this wealth or the rich’s support. Another example would be how they just don’t believe the science. Uncle Pete thinks that this increase in global surface temperature is a natural occurrence that should not be painted as terrifying. This is when it would be nice to be well-versed on the spot, particularly pointing out the gradual growth of temperature overtime, but then specifically focusing on the increase of temperature within the past few decades.
   <br><br>

Not only that, but the tips presented are useful for the future. You mentioned all of them, but I would also like to highlight the significant ones to me. A personal story is engaging as you said, but proves to be a testimony. We have been living through some funky weather! This entire winter quarter has not seen a drip of rain and has been arguably warm to even hot like a summer day. It provides an extent of relatability because what one has experienced, the party being spoken to probably has gone through as well. I did not think of a metaphor being so significant, but I acknowledge how it can contain the issue’s complexity and make it something comprehensible and beautifully presented. Lastly, language is essential because it is what gives them clarification and also explains solutions well, leading me to discuss...
   <br><br>

What Ken touched upon this lecture. People definitely get uncomfortable when someone is vegan, but who more than Uncle Pete who knows you do it for climate change as a reason? I think if your cousin’s stance does get swayed, introduce him to the more “baby steps” to veganism and vegetarianism. What we consume is a big portion of our greenhouse gas emissions and this lecture expanded my mind. For example, climaritism is a great concept. It is the first tentative step and is a bridge to veganism and vegetarianism. It promotes deciding on the more eco-friendly option, such as picking turkey over beef at a restaurant. This makes it easier for those who truly believe they cannot give up meat for the taste, nutritional value, or etc. and does not shame them for not doing all that they can because some action is still better than no action. Freegans have an even more flexible purpose, promoting ideas such as minimizing food waste and cooking as much as you can with what you have purchased. All people make freegan decisions, making it something not so imposing



<br><hr>
I also found myself in a similar situation the past week. I discussed with my friends how I no longer wanted to eat beef and in general eat less meat. They asked me why and I said because beef is very bad for the environment, although they seemed to understand the effects of beef they asked me why should I change if everyone else is still going to eat beef and if the food is already made it is better to just eat it than to let it go to waste, I found myself to be unable to argue back with them. I almost felt a bit ridiculous because I just had to sit there and be like "well idk". I was totally unprepared for comebacks, I wish I had read this article to be more prepared instead of just shutting down.

I really enjoyed this weeks reading as it educated us on the most effective way to communicate with others in regards to climate change. I couldn't help but relate to your experience with your family member as I have found myself in the same situation many times. Often times, I try and inform the person I am having a conversation with of what I know but it is difficult for them to change their opinions and see things from a different perspective. This then leads to me giving up since it's frustrating when no progress is made when trying to help someone understand something from a different perspective. Like you, I wish I had read this weeks reading prior to these conversations as I would have had more tools to try and communicate the correct information to these people. 
   <br><br>

While reading this I couldn't help but think about my high school biology teacher who was a climate change denier. The chapter we read talks about the different strategies we should use when talking to someone about climate change. My teacher would use all of these strategies when trying to convince us that climate change was not anthropogenic. He would use personal stories to get our class engaged and use these personal stories to convince us that climate change was something the government was trying to teach us in order for them to take our money as adults. He knew who his audience was as for most of us in his class it was our first time learning about climate change.Many people who did not have the opportunity to pursue higher education and take classes like this one unfortunately still believe what was taught to them by this teacher, therefore, the uncle Pete's of our generation.



<br><hr>

I agree, this week's reading hit pretty close to home for me. As soon as the fictional character "Uncle Pete" was mentioned, I immediately thought of my father. Whenever I try to have an educated conversation with him about climate change and global warming, he always gives the same excuses that have been fabricated by deniers and conservative think tanks. With that being said, reading this chapter has provided me with the tools I need to prove these phony facts to be incorrect, while also properly educating him about the issue. 

   <br><br>

I believe the best way to do this is to convince him that this effort is not an attempt to gain political power or to limit individual freedom, but a list of necessary actions that must be performed to help mitigate this global threat. My dad, being an extremely logical person, adheres to scientific evidence in every other field except for environmental science. If I could apply the same sciences he believes so deeply in to the world of environmentalism, then maybe he would come to agree with some of my arguments.
   <br><br>


However, as my father grows older, his views and beliefs only become more crystallized, making it harder to convince him of this dystopian reality that we are steadily approaching. I'm trying as hard as I can to convince him because I do not want him to face the consequences when it is too late to reverse our impact on the planet. But if I can successfully do this, then this movement will have one more person backing them in the effort to save the planet.



<br><hr>
I would like to start my reply off with, my LITERAL Uncle Pete is a total climate deny-ist. Like my literal uncle, named Pete. My father’s Trump-loving, climate denying, family-exiled brother, whose name... is Pete. Imagine how I felt reading this chapter. I couldn’t help but laugh a little bit at the irony of it. Anyways, due to some complicated family drama I haven’t seen my uncle Pete in years, but I DO, many times a day in fact, see his wife’s posts on Facebook. And boy if I could post screenshots on this reply I’m sure many of you would get a kick out of it. You’d probably find yourself upset and annoyed (as I do many times a day) though, at the sheer ignorance of her posts. I’ve texted my mom on many occasions before asking her how to handle the internal conflict I face whenever I see my aunt’s posts. A huge part of me wants to spit some straight fire in the comments and educate her. Another part of me wants to ignore it and keep going on with my day though. I think either way what this article has taught me is that it’s important to approach any of these situations in a strategic way. It’s not about berating people with information or hostility, because this will only close them off more. Like you were saying, the use of metaphors, considering one’s audience and what they value, and providing solutions are important aspects of conversing with climate deny-ists that I hadn’t really ever considered before. This article definitely resonated with me as it discussed different approaches to your (in this case MY) “Uncle Pete.” I hope maybe someday the right opportunity arises where maybe in a few, nice and calmly worded comments, I can influence my family.

Hi Ellie! This week's reading has been my favorite so far as well. Similar to you, I have tried to communicate to my mother and sister about this course in the past, but wasn't sure where exactly to start and what information I should say. Like how do I possibly explain to them that if we don't act fast and smart, we won't have a habitable Earth soon. While my sister is only 4 years younger than me and understands the realness of climate change, I sometimes find it difficult to explain to my mom. My mother doesn't know much about climate change so I have taken it upon myself to talk to her about what I am learning and reading in this class. One section of the reading that I found the most helpful and that I related to the most is how to change scientific jargon to regular words. I found it difficult trying to explain what 415 PPM meant to mom, but after reading this piece, I will be more critical of the words I use. 
   <br><br>

After scrolling through Youtube comments for this video, I believe many others along with myself are very grateful to have read the assigned reading for this week. It easily lays out ways to communicate climate change to people who may or may not have an idea of what climate change is. I believe that communicating the effects of climate change to other people is just as important as make individual choices of living a sustainable life to combat climate change. The more that people are informed, the more they will be curious to know more, and they may be more likely to make sustainable life changes.



<br><hr>
I had a very similar experience to you this weekend too actually. My dad and my sister came up to Santa Barbara and I was also explaining my classes to them. While they weren't radically trying to convince me that Climate Change is not real they were slightly skeptical about the enormous dangers and dangers of climate change. My dad was showing us new houses he was looking at, and a new car he wanted to buy for my little sister, and I weirdly found myself thinking thoughts that I never would've even considered, let alone argued with him over. I genuinely felt so bothered by the fact that he was thinking of getting a fully gasoline-powered car instead of buying an electric or hybrid car, that could help the environment. It just didn't make sense to me. But it also didn't make sense to my dad since the last time I saw him at the beginning of the quarter, I was begging him to buy me a Jeep wrangler, which obviously is not an environmentally friendly car by any means. That just showed me the profound impact this class has had on me, my thinking process and my consideration for things other than my material satisfaction and happiness. 
   <br><br>

Now, moving on to the actual reading, I think a lot of the things mentioned in the reading were very interesting. For example, how it talks about Climate change more than just a traditional physical science, rather more of human science, a science of behavior. And that is so true, this class has not focused the majority of its efforts on the science behind climate change and all the ins and outs of greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on the climate. It, however, tended to focus on consumerism, societal expectations, personal and collective ways we can help improve the situation. Another thing you mentioned which I wholeheartedly agree with is how cool language is and the power of language. I think one major reason why we are in the position we are today is because of scientists' failure to communicate in a desirable and understandable way to the public. I think if the problem was efficaciously communicated to the public in the 20th century we would be well on our way to improving the climate situation. 
   <br><br>

I personally think that we as a human population need to before anything come together and realize that climate change is real!! The information the scientists are providing is real! It is reliable! It is accurate and it does not need to be criticized. If climate scientists who spent their time trying to prove that climate change is, in fact, real to skeptics focused and devoted their attention to finding more solutions and routes to cleaner, more environmentally friendly life, and one that did not require so many drastic changes that we are reading about it. At the end of the day, we the human population, and us alone are the reason this is happening and therefore we are going to have to bear the consequences.

Ellie I can certainly relate to your encounter and argument with your cousin. With the topic climate change becoming a politically polarized  debate, it’s not necessarily that only the older generations believe in incorrect information. I also found that unless I’m talking to someone without any understanding of climate, which is a rare occurrence, they already hold their views and opinions. Even when those opinions aren’t backed by facts or truths, someone with their own understanding of climate change aren’t always eager to embrace “more valid” or “better” data and facts. With this being the case, my discussions on climate change with people who hold opposing views often devolve into an unproductive argument.Therefore, I very much appreciate that angle that this reading takes. Regardless of all the correct information and facts, if no one cares or believes it, there’s no point. Therefore, as emphasized by the reading, it’s extremely important to be able to convey those information in a way that’s digestible for whoever else engaging in the conversation. I think if I incorporate those strategies mentioned by the reading, I can have more productive and effective means of communicating. What especially stood out to me was how clear the examples and contents of the reading was conveyed. Rather than having it cluttered with general information, the reading is pinpoint focused on the issue at hand: how to communicate climate chang



<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment! So many people are ignorant and unwilling to make change simply because they do not know what is going on and that's a very sad reality I have had to come to terms with throughout this class. I love your comment about a metaphor- it's so true. Someone that maybe wouldn't be able to wrap their head around climate change in terms of scientific language would totally be able to do so with the use of a metaphor. Overall, I believe that there needs to be a way for the climate skeptic public to learn about what is really going on. There are hard facts related to the changing of the climate, I think scientists maybe just need to dumb down the information for people to understand.




<br><hr>

I agree with you! I thought this week's readings were really insightful, not necessarily in a statistical approach like many of our other readings, but in a more social, modern approach. So many times I am approached in a situation where I feel like I need to prove the significance of climate change to someone who is unknowledgable. Unfortunately, I am often unable to refute some of their points due to my lack of expertise. This chapter gave me a way I can effectively communicate to others why the science is real, using logistics, an appeal to authority, etc. I feel like spreading awareness is one of the best things we can do to help this planet. The more we spread information regarding the issue, the more people that will vote for legislation, the more legislation for the past. I am fully aware we cannot convince all of the Uncle Pete's in the world but we can make it so that they're a small minority.

In response to
Ellie, I agree. I have started to like the mundane small talk conversation of “tell
me what classes you are in,” because of this class. Recently, I was asked this
on a job interview and I began to tell my employer about the change of outlook
I’ve experienced due to this course. When my employer and I talked about the
sheer lack of education surrounding the topic, it instantly gave us a common
ground. The sheer lack of education and debate was acknowledged in this weeks
reading. One thing that was discussed in this reading was that one must always
consider his or her audience. That is something I have gotten in trouble with
in the past. For this reason, I would consider that very important. The reading
also went on to tell us that we must use a personal story which helps prove our
ethos. Personal stories give the audience a chance to relate to the subject,
the reader, and each other. Solutions were also mentioned as a tool when
debating the climate change issue. Solutions are the most effective tool to use
in any argument. An issue with no solution is unthinkable doom that no one
wants to acknowledge. No one wants to listen to that. Thankfully, my employer
did not argue with me, but if he had, this reading would’ve better taught me a
way to present my argument.




<br><hr>

I totally agree with you that this week's reading was my favorite so far! I felt that in this reading I have learned some of the most important things regarding climate change and solutions. We hadn't talked about the communication of climate change and how to speak of it towards people who disagree. I have a similar situation as talking to your cousin however it is my father. The part regarding "Uncle Pete" is extremely relatable and I think was the most helpful content I have learned thus far. My father has many speculations regarding climate change and I generally respond in ways that just cause more anger and frustration. Instead, this reading gives many ways to communicate efficiently and hopefully can effectively educate those who are misinformed. Moreover, not only answering the many false accusations to help others understand, I thought the metaphors were an extremely interesting tactic. It could help people grasp an understanding of how serious climate change is or even just how it works in general to those who have misconceptions about it. Additionally, regarding the video lecture, I was very interested because as someone who is vegetarian, many people become shut down once I say that and I liked how people may open up to the idea of a climatarian even though it may not be completely plant-based, it is still getting it out there and having people take a path towards helping the climate crisis.

I thought this chapter was so interesting.  I'm on the path to hopefully become a linguistics major and I just love seeing how carefully language can be controlled to really deliver the desired purpose.  I have to admit the prospects of people thinking so intently on how to persuade you is a bit worrisome, I guess I personally feel okay because I find the information this chapter is trying to deliver as very important and understand how it is difficult to properly start a dialouge that includes and supports each person in the conversation.  I just really liked how clearly the objectives were laid out.  Five bullet pointed steps that bring you from where you are to where you want to be.  It inspired me to feel like this information wasn't destined to be lost to the general public forever and maybe it is possible to start meaningful conversations where both party can learn and grow and ask good questions, hopefully to find good answers.
   <br><br>
I used the new information I learned on my Dad this week.  He's an English man in his 50s, hes been an engineer since he was in college - pretty much anything that isn't math or bridges is sort of a foreign language to him.  I know my Dad isn't closed minded, but I know he likes linear information and he wants to see how you get from point A to point B no matter the circumstances.  We had spoken about climate issues before, and I got the sense that he knew there was a looming issue but didn't seem to understand how impending the disaster was or how so much of our day to day practices were linked to this crisis.  I tried to start the dialouge by suggesting he watch some of the films we were assigned earlier in the class to contextualize some of the things I was trying to introduce to him.  It felt awesome after our discussion that he and I were really on the same page.  It's almost unfathomable the damage we have done to the planet and it seems almost impossible to introduce someone to that in one sit down conversation.  But he was really receptive and I felt like the skills I learned from this chapter really made that possible.  This chapter and that interaction with my Dad gave me a lot of hope and pride.

Well, I think, for most people, the reason why they do not believe in climate change is not education. Many high positioned officers in our society have made comments that they do not believe climate change is a thing running on the earth, and they all received very high education at least master degrees. Ignoring whether climate change is true or not, the only reason why they do not believe climate change is that they do not wish to take the prices for being an environmental enthusiastic. In our society's views, being environmental protectors means they have to watch what they do all the time and their companies cannot produce and use any materials that are not environmentally friendly. This price is too high to take. Unless technologies improve to the level that we are all accessible to cheap clean energy, nothing would change, at least not for people who make money by not being environment friends.

It’s crazy to read this response from Ellie as I do the same with my family when coming home from school at any time. Personally, my father is a carnivore, Republican, and even very strong in his ideas and thoughts about politics and life as a whole. He does have very closed views on how he was brought up and the way he’s lived his life to survive up until then. Talking to my father about these topics we are learning in English 23 and ways that we can change the climate crisis has been overall a difficult thing. Breaking the barrier to speak to my father and get across the knowledge I’ve learned regarding this without seeming completely radical is a grey area in our discussions about the climate crisis being a real thing. As Ken mentions, the start to helping the climate through diet can be done by little steps simply by having a plant based diet, even if that means just eating less meat overall such as being a pescatarian like Ken was at one point. I do agree with Ellie on this as well how the aspects discussed in the reading as being graceful and understanding with sending these messages create for a much more effective persuasive strategy in trying to stir up change among our culture.

 I agree with you completely. After week 8’s reading assignment, I learned how to communicate with people around me better than before, especially on the issue of climate change. The most important one I learned through “Communicating Climate Change Science” chapter 8 is that when you are expressing yourself, getting straight to your ideas is very critical. Once you are off track, your listeners would lose interest and become confused, thus, they will stop listening. Back then, especially with my parents, I have a hard time expressing my ideas and thoughts with them because as they say, we have a “generation” gap, we have very different perspectives of seeing and understanding things. I’m still working on convincing my parents to change our family diet, which is to include more plant-based dishes when preparing a meal, and eating less meat, less often.

I agree with you and I personally enjoy reading this week's reading materials because they are so helpful. Communicating with others about the climate change topic is hard but necessary. I strongly resonate with your story since I go through the exactly same thing. My family members know that climate is in crisis. The news report it everyday. But they just don't take any action to solve the problem. They know our planet is under threat, but they don't believe their personal power to make changes.
   <br><br>
The reading addresses the communication skills. I really like the part of expressing clear, simple messages. Personally thinking, many people don't take actions because all the information they received are way too complex. They regard the climate problem as the thing which could only be solved by the governors, the wealth, the people holding power. They regard the problem too big and out of their control. So sometimes keeping the information simple is the best way to educate them.
   <br><br>
The strategy of using metaphor is also interesting and new. I haven't thought it before as a way to discuss climate change. Actually using metaphors is creating a common language between the teller and the listener since metaphor is really easy to get. I will definitely try to use this strategy to give out more information to my family members.
   <br><br>
Finally, yielding solutions is extraordinarily important. Many people regard climate crisis a big problem because they don't think there is any way to improve the situation. This is because different medias are expressing information instead of solutions. Gradually people think climate crisis is not solvable. However, that mindset should change. The first thing people can do is to learn more about the situation, knowing there are solutions, and it can be done by simple human beings.

I really like your comment because you discussed your recent interaction with your family, specifically with your 23-year-old cousin. I can admit that when I am asked about the classes I am taking I think very carefully of my word choice when I am discussing this class specifically to a family member that I believe to have some reservations about the climate crisis. I do agree with you that I too have wished to have done this week reading earlier because it would have been very helpful for me trying to navigate a conversation while trying to not trigger a full-on argument because that is not the intention when trying to convince climate deniers that the science behind the climate crisis is real and this is one of the most important issues of the 21st century. I also agree with you that this chapter did an excellent job of giving good examples and steps on how to talk to someone about the climate crisis. Like using a metaphor to simplify the complexity that is the climate crisis but then the person you are talking to can make a personal connection. I would have never thought to have used a personal story either, and I am not so eager to admit that I sometimes avoid this topic of conversation with my family because I tend to get frustrated when I feel like I am not being heard correctly. As you mentioned in your comment how language is so important and we need to learn how to use the proper language when discussing the climate crisis because we do not need unnecessary hostility because we all need to work together if we want to change the way we treat our planet for future generations. I also agree with what you said regarding the chapter saying that if you know your audience you can even more effectively talk about the climate crisis and educate people without making them feel attacked for their lack of knowledge.

I also enjoyed the reading as it gave a way to communicate different opinions towards disbelievers. The main reason I feel people don't believe in climate change is because they do not know a lot about the actual issue. This is because of all the scientific jargon used in published articles which makes it harder for people to understand. This is also a cause of people believing they have no effect or impact on the already occurring crisis. like you said climate change is more than a statistic and we need to get people to do their part. 
   <br><br>
Not everybody has to become vegans or vegetarians, even I wouldn't do that, but if we all make an effort to cut back on our beef consumption just a little then we are making progress towards a better climate. The main way that we can help our climate is by raising awareness so that everybody knows how important their individual role is.



<br><hr>
I agree that this weeks readings was also one of my favorites, however this comment is honestly one of the best ones that I have seen throughout my time in this course. The fact that you took the time to take what you have learned in this class and share that knowledge with those who are not informed on the subject is very encouraging. I hope that more people when presented with an opportunity like this would do the same and take the time to not argue with someone who is less informed, but rather take the time to educate and have a civil discussion on what we as people need to do better in order to improve the current state of our planets climate. This is how people should be approaching the subject of climate change. Having civil discussion with family members and educating people in ways that do not spark aggression will lead to more people wanting to talk about the subject. The only way to actually improve our situation in regard to the climate crisis has been shown again and again throughout this course, and that is that people need to start taking action. This comment was amazing, I myself would love to have an opportunity like this and I hope that when people complete this class and return home to their families that more people will have stories like this to share. This has easily been the most practical class I have taken throughout my life and I hope more people get the chance to take this class and become more educated on this subject.

I found this comment very interesting. I also have trouble communicating the issue to my family. They are very conservative and at times can be very closed-minded, this is one of those times. Any mention of climate change will have them rolling in laughter with exclamations such as, then why did I have to put on a jacket today, and yay that means the beach will be closer. It's really amazing to me that this is my own family and they don't want to believe in facts and statistics. Why they do not believe the scientists are most likely because of our president right now. This is where communication needs to be. WE are not doing a good enough job communicating to the older generations about how much we really need to change the habits that we started after WWII, because it's not about them anymore, it's about the younger generations that really care.




<br><hr>
I completely agree with you in regard to education being a main factor in climate change. In order to make a big impact on climate change by making personal adjustments, the majority of our population needs to do so. Therefore, in order to get the majority of the population to cooperate and make lifestyle adjustments, the general public needs to get educated on the topic of climate change. At first, I was also shocked whenever I would come across someone who did not believe in climate change and refused to make lifestyle changes for the sake of our environments. However, it is understandable that people are not completely willing to make sacrifices when they have not been informed about the consequences or they see political leaders that deny the legitimacy of climate change. Thus, it is important to inform and educate the general public of climate change and the very real consequences that we will face if we do not make changes as soon as possible. I agree that the best way to reach a mass amount of people is to present information through a meaningful emotional way in order to make the information really sink in.




<br><hr>

I also found this reading helpful. Communication is a skill that is needed in basically every field, not just climate science. This article was a good example on how to talk to someone who is not familiar with your field, and may not trust you either. Gaining that trust and communicating ideas through metaphors can be effective. As the reading mentioned, we like to trust the people who share our values, so that is an effective way to gain trust.
   <br><br>
What is kind of funny is that the author used the some of  the same techniques on the reader. Notably, Uncle Peat is kind of a metaphor.




<br><hr>
I'm glad to hear that this chapter really helped you in discovering ways to guide your own 'uncle Pete' in the future, although it makes me even more happy to know that you were still trying to do it even before doing the reading. I feel like one current issue with the climate crisis and 'uncle Pete' types of people is the power dynamic that is often associated with these conversations. Often times, the 'Pete' is a parent, grandparent, or other traditional authority figure and that makes it hard to challenge what they say and voice your own opinion on it. Even with the help from the chapter, I fear that this will still be a big issue, and thus will make less people able to communicate as easily as you have. Standing up to authority figures is hard enough with a small or more personal issue, so when it comes to an even bigger issue such as this it becomes almost impossible. I'm curious as to more ways that would help address this concern specifically or if it really is just a matter of being braver or something like that.




<br><hr>
I definitely agree with you on this! I feel like while I'm at UCSB almost everyone is very aware of the climate change issue, but when I go home it's a whole different realm. My family, and a lot of people back home know little to nothing about climate change. I've learned throughout this class that it actually isn't uncommon for people to not know about climate change, so I do my best to try and educate and inform them on my lifestyle decisions and choices. I really enjoyed reading this article because I think it is very helpful and I feel as if I can communicate the issue a lot better than before. I too think this article highlights the importance of talking about climate change and spreading awareness through one's own personal journey.

This week's reading on communicating climate issues was a very eye-opening read for me. I had always acknowledged the disconnect between the information researchers collected and the information revealed to the public. Though climate euphemisms may be used to more easily convey information to those not educated on the topic, I feel that "dumbing down", for lack of better terms, is actually hurting the climate change movement. As Ken has said time and time again, one off the root causes of our present state is the general lack of knowledge regarding these issues. While a short term solution like making the information more easily digestible for readers is feasible, it doesn't fix the near non-existent means of education regarding the topic of anthropogenic climate change in the US.



<br><hr>

I was recently in a similar situation. I was with some of my extended family and somehow my classes got brought up. I mentioned this class and was immediately shut down and overwhelmed with claims that the climate crisis has been blown out of proportions, that it is not anthropogenic, and so on. I did not want to come off as a foolish hipster-snob who thought he knew better than everyone else, so I just kept my mouth shut as my family members (all of whom were boomers) discussed there opinions on the climate crisis or "lack thereof". This week's reading and this video were very helpful to me. I am a lot more confident about discussing topics relating to climate change with those that do not believe it exists, or that it is not as major as people make it out to be.

   <br><br>

On a side note,  the ideas of being a freegan or climatarian were brand new to me, but very intriguing. Since the beginning of this course, I have been doing my best to eat what was more environmentally- friendly, but I did not know there was a name for it. I have not been doing as well as I had hoped or planned, but I will continue to try to keep the impact on the environment a certain food has when deciding what to eat. Hopefully, this will lead to me becoming more and more aware of what I decide to eat.

I agree. Ken is being a climate communicator. He's been using metaphors. Like in his lecture about how 3/4 of human GHG was in his generation about how people smoked with impunity and then the  younger generations had to suffer. He also compared fossil fuel to smoking because we're addicted to it.

   <br><br>

One of the things I found amusing: the scientific jargon vs what they mean to the public. I found the example of “positive feedback” hilarious. A solemn scientist saying that arctic ice melting leads to less reflection of sunlight leads to more melting is a positive feedback, and the public hearing that, smiling and saying “oh! How wondrous!” I would like more charts like those, on how to better communicate science with the public. This reading is very useful. Because I can vote, I can change my actions. How am I going to talk to other people about it? Especially deniers without getting into a fight? 

   <br><br>

Science communication is important. Shouting facts and following trends with hashtags on twitter won't solve issues. You can say all that, but you've got to act it too. But also communicate it. People are very aware. It's that they don't act, or won't act on their own. Screaming at uncle pete won't get him to believe science. We must be civil. Moreover, at the core, it isn't the science he disagrees with. It's what he thinks it will entail. It contradicts his other systems of beliefs and wants, such as free market, etc with increased gov't power, limits on personal freedom, etc. Though ironically, gov't will increase because climate change is a threat multiplier. The author compared doing nothing to avoid costs to not doing a bypass surgery. It will result in more costs in the future. Climate change is real but people are denying because it doesn't match their belief system.

   <br><br>

So yes, we need votes, we also need communication and personal change. Combined with personal change, such as Ken's example of him identifying as "vegan" vs "climatarian", people will be more likely to listen. Yeah, the cap and trade that Obama tried to pass. It passed, but CTT swayed public opinion. That's why we need communication.

<br><hr>
I agree with you. Communication is really an important part. We not only need to communicate the topic of environmental protection with the people around us, but also use the correct communication methods. If we just explain to them our bad situation and what we need to do, they may feel boring, and our words will become meaningless. The book also shows this point: Climate scientists often fall into this trap when trying to explain what they have learned to the broad public. They know a lot, so they want to say a lot. That's a mistake. Ken lifted himself Example: He tells how he explained to others his life as a minimalist and vegetarian. I appreciate his respect for everyone's choice. During the conversation, he took care not to shape himself into a morally high person. This way the person talking to him will not feel much pressure and will be more willing to think deeply about the topic he is presenting. I decided to influence the people around me in this way too, so that they take environmental protection seriously.



<br><hr>
Absolutely, it is very important to find a practical strategy in communication that will help convincing people more than direct promoting or advertising certain activities. After all, it's others' personal choices to decide whether or not to set something as a goal. For people who are already acting such as being a vegan or vegetarian, their main concerns should be guiding others to actually learn about it on their own. By directly making claims such as "I am a vegan" doesn't help correcting the stereotypical impressions some might have about being a vegan. In my case, I have decided to become a vegan after watching the film "Cowspiracy", my roommate who usually eat with me did not get used to my sudden change. I was having a hard time communicating with him since he has a belief like most people that "vegan" is considered outlier(which I couldn't really argue against in our society), as a result, he often attempts to convince me to stop my "none-sense" and come back on having a meat diet. At first, I didn't feel the need to complicate the fact of me being a vegan so soon, as it was just simply a choice of mine, and I didn't know if it's doable or healthy for me yet (so far after 3 weeks it works for me very well, although I took some time to learn how to balance my diet to make sure I don't miss any nutrition that is important). So I simply said that I have become an vegan without proper explanations. So here is my failure in communication that leads to his repellent. I wonder how should I change in communication to at least guide him into forming a proper perspective about the choice of being a vegan.

<br><hr>

I agree with you, MisterTracks! Ken's content is quite amazing, interesting, and consistent enough to educate the public on the climate crisis in short, entertaining videos. 
   <br><br>

Ken is an excellent climate communicator, and we can see that with these videos.
   <br><br>

The videos are posted on YouTube, a public website that the majority of people have access to (he also put these videos up on his website for people who don't have access to YouTube). However, he doesn't send out these videos, put ads out for these videos, and he doesn't have bots promoting his contenet (or at least that I know of). 
   <br><br>

When one is ready to educate themselves on this topic, they have these videos within reach. Each video is short (compared to a 2-hour long nature documentary). I would argue that Ken's short videos are entertaining (although this claim may be considered biased). They are split up by different topics, and give an effective rundown on the climate crisis.
   <br><br>

Despite taking his class for two-quarters, this is the first time I've heard of Ken's dietary restrictions for the environment. In fact, I've noticed that he seldom speaks of his personal experience regarding climate change, which is refreshing to not hear someone brag about their personal experiences. It's is nice to hear that Ken practices what he preaches, it's encouraging to see that he's in this fight with us.


<br><hr>

I agree with you both that a correct form of communication is dire in presenting and conveying messages, which in this case pertain to veganism, and/or climitarianism. Just as Ken described his conscious choice in food choice, over meals with friends, has had the same impact in my experience. Within my own group of friends here, by voicing their own concerns and joining alongside them for meals, I along with others often find ourselves encouraged to choose a healthier or more climate beneficial meal option. I feel that the need for one's own curiosity must be sparked, in order to wish to be further educated or learn more about any topic, including as hard as it can be to believe, climate positive actions. As we've explored this quarter, I feel that the by leading my example, as well as through advocating, we can really introduce and help to lead by change. Just as the article speaks about we tend to relate to others who speak their values, and as such, may be a beneficial approach in describing your dietary changes and the impact its held for you.


<br><hr>
I want to think that people who were reluctant  to change may be hard to persuade, but these small tactics seem to be useful. Like the uncle pete in the book, but I do not agree with the assumption in that book that everyone has such a person around. From my own perspective, I would say that these environmental deniers form their own cycle that stop correct information from being conveyed to them. It is quite rare to have a climate denier father while all relatives around are environmental protection supporters. Hence, it provides great difficulties for the communications to be really effective. But if provided such situations, what Ken said in the video is interesting and may be quite productive. Saying freeman and environmentarian instead of vegan is effective. From my own experience, vegan doesn’t leave a good impression on me either. I thought they left an impression of weirdos and I often unconsciously associated them with Nervosas, those skinny scary figures. And therefore if they are associated with environmental protection, then I will certainly not protect the environment.




<br><hr>

I really agree with you. After taking Ken's classes, I have more clear views about vegetarian, vegans and freegans. It is not necessary for us to become a strict vegans, but we can still reduce global emissions by eating less meat. After reading the book, I learn more skills about communication which is really important for solving climate crisis. One of these solutions are metaphors. Using metaphors is more effective for people to understand and remember.The author gives us examples of catchy. Co2 is just like steroids of our climate.
   <br><br>


The reading also mentioned about language. The writer believes the language is really important when the climate becomes more scientific. We should also use units that are familiar to my listeners. These units are crucial for our communication.



<br><hr>
I agree with you. Ken is the only person I know that deeply fight with climate change and teach people about climate change. Although Ken is the generation of people who benefit from and cost climate change, he did not escape that and try to fix the problem. He also teaches us how to fix the problem and can't ignore the problem until too late. I agree with that. Since climate change is admitted of no delay, we can't ignore it and let our descendants fix it. We should fix this and end the problem with this generation, our generation. We should not let the problem pass through. This is the most important message that Ken teaches us.




<br><hr>

People can overwhelm those unfamiliar with veganism and shame them into feeling dumb or talked down to on a moral level. I agree that correct communication can help avoid our words from becoming meaningless and make our message something meaningful. Furthermore, our words can push people away as they are negative and can make others want to avoid it completely. Instead, we should inspire hope for a cleaner future and the nets that would be provided for us under the Green New Deal. For this reason, I also respect Ken's respect for everyone's choice. The goal should be to inform and inspire, not convert as many people are fine as they are. They have to be reassured that going vegetarian can be done and that by taking gradual steps to incorporate veganism and vegetarianism. In all, I hope more people realize the impact they can have on our planet and the power they hold.

You have a lot of interesting points about how to approach speaking to people about the lifestyle that you have chosen. I also think one needs to humble themselves and not make their audience feel like they are less than these people; they are the ones trying to make them follow. I understand that these people are solely responsible for their own decisions and all we can do to communicate the severity of the issue is to generate a lot of attention and discussion about it. When we people see that other people care about an issue, they are forced to care about that issue as well and they might even do their own part in the discussion if we trigger the right discussions.
   <br><br>
I feel that this is very important because if one is just calling us out for our faults and the repercussions  of our actions and not stating a solution, we generally try to avoid those sentiments, cause we know they are making the right points but are hitting our ego the wrong way. Also, our country has been moving in a very divisive direction, more divisive than ever in fact.

Out of all the readings, I think I was able to get the most out of this week's reading. In this week's reading, I learned how important it is to communicate about climate change and how to communicate effectively with non believers, otherwise known in the book as "Uncle Petes". I have an uncle that is like that. Every time I go to a family gathering, I always hear my uncle preach about how climate change is a hoax. I would always argue with my uncle about this, and the argument would always end with one of us being dragged away from the other. After reading this week's reading, I realized that my approach in regards of this topic was not the most effective. When arguing with him, I realized after reading this that the facts I spewed at him were rendered useless because he did not understand what I said due to the scientific jargon I used. This reading taught me techniques on how to effectively communicate about the climate crisis, which I will the next time I see my uncle. After reading this week's reading, I realized the importance of how to effectively communicate about the climate crisis.

I can definitely relate to your experience of fighting with family members about climate change, and from reading the comments on this video, I think a lot of other people can relate too. Usually, I tend not to engage with my relatives who deny climate change. There are two reasons I don’t try to persuade them: one, because deep down I know that no matter what I say, they will not care or believe, and two, because everyone else in my family is so aggressively vocal about it that my added voice would only feed the fire. One thing that this reading helped me with was feeling like even if I don’t do the communicating myself, I could share some of the tactics with my siblings who do do the talking. For example, the part about not using scientific jargon. Another thought I had about this book is how sad it is that we need it in the first place. I wish journalists and scientists and politicians did a better job explaining the climate crisis. It kind of reminds me of the Vox video about tactical framing; the articles that o explain climate change often do so in a way that is too complicated, and if someone doesn’t want to believe, they probably won’t be spending their time trying to work through a dense article. However, even though I find it depressing, I am very glad that we have this book to help.


<br><hr>
Yeah, it’s related to me as well. I have many family members who do not take climate crisis as a serious problem. When I tell them about the fact, they would just deny it. After this weeks’ reading, I learned more about how to communicate, which is so important. I’ll try next time when I see them. If it does not work, I won’t waste any more time convincing them. I like Ken’s video this week about veganism. My mom is a vegetarian, and she tried to make me be vegetarian as well. However, I used to reject it all the time as i viewed being a vegetarian is just a way to lose weight, which is definitely not the case. Now, I’ll try to be a vegan.

I find it interesting that most comments I have read on this video indicate a positive reaction to the reading material, and statements that say it could be helpful to them. I feel quite the opposite. I think that people like “Uncle Pete” are a lost cause. It is not worth the time or energy to try and convince them to understand environmentalism and the urgency of the climate crisis, because it simply won’t have that much of an effect on solving issues. A lot of Americans simply do not value education, and therefore do not take the time or have the desire to learn anything more than what they are told and will reject anything new to them. People with closed minds will have to pass out of relevance (die) in order for change to occur. I think it is a fundamental flaw of American society, the individualist nature, the lake of value for education, and the lack of desire for collective development. And these things will not be remedied for climate or environmental action through conversation. They may for open-minded people, willing to change themselves, but those are few and far between, and often just uneducated on the issues. And in this day and age, with high incidence of internet access, self-education on issues that effect everyone should be more common than it is. I think it shows an inherent lack of communal value and desire to be educated in the American public, that we have people like “Uncle Pete”.

Sadly, I have to agree with you. Arguing with an “Uncle Pete” could be compared to beating a dead horse. I have plenty of members of my family that fall into this category and I have been trying to tell them the damage that the climate crisis will cause. Most of them have yet to listen. No one wants to change their lifestyle this much for something that a majority of other people aren’t paying any mind to. I’m a Communication Major so I thought this subject would be easier for me since I have literally studied the best ways to deliver information, but it is still difficult. 
   <br><br>

I truly resonate with what Ken said about being a vegan. When I first went vegan and told my friends and family about it, most of those conversations would stop there. I also see it all over social media: people think that vegans think that they are superior and some vegans truly think that they are. It’s difficult being associated with that mindset and I found myself caving under what other people said. I eat vegan probably about 95% of the time. I only buy and make vegan food, but eating out or being cooked for by other people makes it difficult to follow that strict lifestyle. I found myself becoming more lenient, eating vegan as much as possible but bending when it came down to the small number of options I had in some situations. I don’t believe I am superior to others because of the way I eat, I just wanted to feel like I could control something in this situation we are in. I really like that Ken introduced the terms climatarian and freegan. I feel like using these terms are less scary to people who don’t want to cut as much stuff out of their diet.

When reading Chapter 8 from "Communicating Climate Change Science", I really enjoyed the reading. I feel that I really enjoyed the reading because it left me feeling very optimistic where previous readings I have read made me feel pessimistic because some of them state all the things we are doing drastically wrong, but does not offer a solution that would be very possible for us to do at that very moment. I liked how one of the main ideas of the reading was how If you are writing a climate change article then you must provide solutions. I feel that this is very important because if one is just stating what we are doing wrong and the consequences of our actions and not stating a solution, then we tend to get discouraged and continue not act. I really enjoyed the metaphor of the thermostat as well because, if we all work together we have the means to prevent further increase in climate temperature. In terms of mentioning if one is a vegan, I tend to be very interested in my friends who are one and ask them questions on the type of food they eat. I never saw it as a topic that they bring up to make themselves feel superior. I think this may be the case because I am not a vegetarian, but I do not eat meat very often because I just do not like it. I may feel this way with my friends because I eat the same things they eat, but I cannot put the label of vegetarian on myself because I do admit that I do eat meat on very rare occasions. This case may be different for those who consume meat on a daily basis. Lastly, I like in the article how there is a summary of the facts of climate change on a numeric list. I feel with past readings such as the past two weeks readings, I got very confused because there was an overabundance of things listed and none of them were repeated. I think it is important to construct articles so that they are understandable instead of using scientific terms because that would be like trying to convince other scientists on a topic they most likely already know much about.

This week’s reading is different from others i’ve read. It’s talking about the communication skill of climate change science. And this makes me feel surprised and suddenly realized that it’s not enough to just discussing about the impact of climate change or what we can do to help with climate change. All those discussion are useless without effective and accessible communication as it’a important to let listeners to understand the point so that they can realized how severe the climate change is and how important it is to take actions now.
   <br><br>
There are two points that i felt completely agree in Ken’s lecture. Firstly, Ken’s points out that talking to others’ ear off is not a successful way to spur people to action. And he talks about a best time and best talking way which i also found it to be effective to communicate new idea by using his own example of having food with his friends and trying to communicate his idea to his friends. He also claims that this climate strategy not only leverage personal actions, but also encourage others to act. Then, i felt completely agree with his says that before you can change the world, you need to change yourself, otherwise you may cause more trouble.
   <br><br>
In the reading there are more specific details of communication are pointed out and make me more clearly about how to deliver scientific information in more accessible and effective ways. There are five steps are shown in the chapter which are preparing well, story, metaphors, language and solutions. Both are reasonable useful and also logical. As in the step one, preparing well, the reading first pointed out the fact that people especially climate scientists often communicate by using “complex subject” and ignore “simple clear message”  and this will make people have difficulties figuring out the important point. In addition, the reading also mentions the North-South equity issue. Then, the skill to improve communication for the first step is shown. Firstly, considering audiences. “knowing who the audience members are, and learning what they care most about”. Then, we need to emphasize the point that climate change is close to us, and making connection between climate change and what people experience in our daily life. The second one is to know yourself, to analyze your strengths and weaknesses and show that you are a warm, likable, knowledgeable, and trustworthy person so that listener will truly listen to you. Also, it’s important to be well-informed and get familiar with the details of some facts and findings especially “details about how these observations are made and why they are trustworthy”.

I had a much more positive reaction to this piece than those we have read in previous weeks. I thought that this piece was fair and not condescending while still vigorously defending what the author sees as undeniable truths. I think the assigned readings and videos of the last few weeks, such as the videos about the Green New Deal, presented climate change as so obvious that only somebody who was willfully ignorant would ignore it. That messaging is prone to come off as condescending and is likely to alienate people not yet willing to support broad climate legislation. This piece instead acknowledged common misconceptions that people have about climate change and provided ways to respectfully teach people what science has established. While the science presented is pretty much the same, the way in which this piece distributed it seemed much more likely to be received well by those who need to be convinced. Simply yelling at people you deem "climate deniers" does not accomplish anything, and this piece provides real strategies to persuading those skeptics.
   <br><br>
I thought the part about "metaphors" presented very good solutions to teaching people about climate science. I think that approach is very smart because it presents climate science in a way that can be received by the people who currently are likely to doubt climate science. There is no need to convince most people who are scientists that climate change is real, since most of them already believe in it. Therefore, spitting out statistics is not going to be useful in swaying public opinion. Using metaphors that all people will understand can help reach people who don't understand complex science.

In the lecture video “Communicating the Climate Crisis” Ken had some interesting points about how to approach speaking to people about the lifestyle that you have chosen. Instead of coming off as someone who is superior it is diffidently better, in my opinion, to inform in a positive manner so that people feel welcomed into changing their ways. I think that the reading as well has many good points on how to bring about the conversation. I think that before informing others it is important to inform oneself on the decisions you will be making. We have to have communicate a clear message without over doing it so we don’t bore those we talk to about our decisions. I think it is important to include stories and metaphors to try and captivate an audience so that they can relate to what you are speaking about and to include solutions so that they are not overwhelmed by hopelessness.

This week's reading, "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions", was a different spin on personal action and I found it very informational. It contained several different examples of how to better our communication skills when it comes to discussing the climate crisis. I think it is very important too, that they supplied steps on how to not only be a skillful communicator, but an effective one. I hadn't really thought about "how" to address climate change with my friends before reading this week's text and watching Ken's video. Specifically after watching Ken's video, I have realized just how critical our ways of communicating are to getting our point across. It isn't just a matter of telling someone what the climate crisis is, there is a way to do so effectively and strategically.
   <br><br>
As Ken addressed in his example of explaining veganism, the best time to talk to someone about something as controversial as climate change, is when they are reading to hear what you have to say. It is important to wait for the hints or cues that implement they are interested in hearing about the topic, and maybe even about your personal perspective on it. I also found it very interesting how Ken said that you shouldn't start off this conversation about you; why you are doing this or that or why you think it is a good idea. Unfortunately, I am guilty of bringing my own personal perspective into my communication before, and I now understand why this hinders my friend(s) from understanding the whole point of the conversation. Communication is a two-way street and the person on the other side needs to be ready and willing to hear you in order for there to be any point in the conversation. I think this was a very important thing for us to learn. Without this knowledge, we will continue to have pointless communication about an issue that needs urgent understanding. 
   <br><br>
At this day and age, communication has gone technological and mainly takes form on different platforms of social media. It isn't personal anymore. Instead, we are able to say whatever we want to say without anyone knowing if this is how we truly feel or if what we are saying is actually factual. The communication skills presented in the week's reading, and explained in Ken's video, are critical to the spread of climate change awareness. We, as a generation, need to implement these skills and step outside of our little comfort zone behind a screen. Personal action needs to be an action; not just an instagram post or a tweet about change.

I could not agree with you more if I tried. Throughout my young life I was guilty of trying to start conversations about things I found interesting, and as a result, I came off as very pompous and self-centered to a lot of people. However, since I realized my mistake, I have begun to implement that very important change with how I interact with people, and I have learned that sometimes, it results in my desired subject not coming up at all, but that is alright, because it is just one story I wanted to tell. The larger issue though, deals with the climate crisis, because it is hard to convince people to change their lifestyle without the subject coming up, and if you never bring it up yourself, there is no promise it will come up at all.
    <br><br>

How should we address this dilemma? I mean, I get that through diet change a person can curtail their emissions drastically, but without talking about it, how do we convince someone to change their behaviors? Do we just risk the topic not coming up, and therefore risk not providing people with ways to live with the environment in mind?

I found “Communicating Climate Change Science” to be really helpful, because everyone who has knowledge or interest in environmental issues can learn from it. Personally, reading this chapter helped me to understand why the way I was talking to my family and friends about the climate crisis could be ineffective. Like many scientists (although I wouldn’t call myself a scientist quite yet) I come home from UCSB absolutely bursting with new information and ideas that I’ve learned in classes like this one, and I’m eager to share them all. I can sometimes end up dumping all of this information on my relatives at once, and while they might seem temporarily interested, I could never understand why that passion and interest never seemed to last past the first conversation. This reading helped me to see that this overwhelming amount of information can often leave people with no idea what to do; a more effective strategy is to relate information about the climate crisis to your audience’s own life. For instance, my grandmother loves to garden. An effective way to talk about the climate crisis with her might be to explain how great growing your own food is for the planet, and what an impact that can have. This could then spur on a conversation in which she feels comfortable to naturally ask questions like how she can do even better in reducing her carbon footprint. Before reading this chapter, I had always wondered why, when there was so much undeniable science and information available about climate change, people could remain so ignorant about it. Better communication with the public about this information could definitely be a way to inspire great leaps forward in fighting the climate crisis.

Much like you shared, I also tend to go back home feeling excited to share everything that I am learning. I am especially eager to share what I am learning in this class because it is so applicable to our everyday lives. While my family may indulge me in letting me talk about organic chemistry and differential equations, it is obviously much more interesting for them to hear about something that actually affects them. Something that I never considered before reading this chapter was that I am very likely overloading my family with too much information, washing away the true importance of what I am trying to get across. While I am very grateful to have a family mainly made up of open minded people that want to listen to me, I failed to consider that despite their interest they can only take in so much at one time. My struggle is less with “Uncle Pete,” because I know very few, but rather with my communication with those who want to make changes but are unsure of what they could do to make a considerable difference. As stated in the reading, it is not enough to just know your audience, you need to know yourself as well. While you may already have a great, engaged audience you need to hold up your part of the deal as well and deliver an organized, easily digestible argument.  
    <br><br>


Another thing I really enjoyed about your comment was how you used the example of communicating with your grandmother by drawing on her interest in gardening. It is really thoughtful that you would stop to consider what your grandmother enjoys so that you could use that to start a conversation that is more natural for her rather than jumping right in and overwhelming her with the climate crisis. Along a similar vein, in the reading we were told about professor Katherine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and a Christian, who uses her religious background to her advantage when communicating about climate change with other religious people. Hayhoe is able to take this common belief system and implement it into her communication, which helps people make associations and keeps them interested. It is such an incredible idea to think about how we can connect people’s interests and beliefs into our communication strategies because it makes things not only more effective, but more personal as well. When we come off as too removed from people and seem to be only invested in cold hard facts this might not resonate well with our family and friends. It can be easy to get swept up in talking about numbers and figures, especially when that is so encouraged in a school setting, but just as this class reminds us, we need to consider the climate crisis in a social manner not just a scientific one. 

    <br><br>

I completely agree that improving our communication about climate change could be a really effective strategy to use in the fight to mitigate it. If we are able to convince more people that climate change is happening now, and that there is sound science behind it, then we can also convince them that we can take steps to help limit the damage. The more people we convince, the more people that make personal changes, the more people that will vote for politicians that will make sweeping climate policies, and the more people that will become activists. While technology and science are great tools that should absolutely be used in the fight, we should also consider just how powerful our voices are.

I really found Ken's story in this video extremely helpful for portraying the strategies explained in "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions," Ken probably could've done a whole lecture video like this one. 
    <br><br>

The strategies discussed in the reading and in the video were very simple and easy to understand. These are the kind of climate change strategies I find extremely useful and the kinds we need to help spread awareness. We have to remember that just because you are vegan, doesn't mean you won't be doing  turning people away from fighting climate change. Before this class I used to frequently talk down about vegans for example because I had been witness to that moral superiority from a vegan. Of course, now I hold a deep respect for them, but it's critical we know how our words COMBINED with actions can lead to an expansive ripple effect in combating climate change. 
    <br><br>

I love the idea of becoming a "Climatarian"  (not sure if that's how you spell it) because it feels alot more bite sized for me right now. Just thinking of becoming a vegan is a little daunting to me because I'm not confident i can do it, yet. Saying im a climatarian at least gives me that hope that it's something I can build up to while building other green habits along the way. It's a great way to expand the audience, an important concept discussed in the UC reading, and provide a wider cultural change.

I completely agree that Ken’s personal example of sharing his vegan lifestyle nicely portrayed the strategies mentioned in the reading, especially the language section. Rather than using such a widely known word that most people have a predetermined opinion on, such as “vegan,” it can be helpful to use “climatarian.” Not many people are aware of this new word and will respond with a curiosity that they would not have about veganism. This curiosity can start a conversation that mentions several important factors such as our diet’s effect on our planet, what foods are more environmentally friendly than others, and why we should care about any of it. As mentioned in the reading, this strategy “turns the argument upside down” by taking a different approach than a climate scientist would. If people wanted scientific facts and figures they would do the research on their own, they would not bring it up at dinner. What people really want from a conversation over dinner is a more casual conversation, and essentially a “why should this matter for my life” moment that will convince them without being too scientific or harsh. 

    <br><br>

I also really enjoy the idea of “climatarianism” because it offers more flexibility and is able to start conversations like Ken mentioned. Despite everything that is vegan being labeled as such in the dining hall it can be tough to find all the alternatives that you might have when cooking your own food. Right now that is my main excuse for why I have not converted to a completely vegan diet, but with climatarianism you do not need excuses, you simply do what you can for the good of the environment. I think that being a climatarian eliminates a lot of guilt that you might feel if you are unable to fully commit to veganism for whatever reason might be holding you back. Rather than taking a full dive into veganism, which might work for some and be very short lived for others, being a climatarian is a good transitional step. 

    <br><br>

Ken’s lecture also touched on the preparation step of being an effective vegan or climatarian. Before going out to dinner it is pretty typical for most people with special diets or restrictions to do research. Rather than doing the research and keeping that information to yourself it might be helpful to keep some notes handy to refer to if a friend was to ask about why you chose to eat as you do. While your friends may not end up asking it is better to come prepared and not have to use the research notes than to end up having nothing ready to say if asked.

This weeks reading, "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions", was an  turn on close to home and I thought that it was very instructive. It contained a few unique instances of how to better our relational abilities with regards to talking about the atmosphere emergency.
         <br><br>
    I think it is significant as well, that they provided steps on the best way to not exclusively be a handy communicator. Another point that I thought was truly intriguing was educator Ken's contention that we ought not be the ones to start the discussion, yet rather live by model and let others ask about the decisions you make for nature. 
    <br><br>

I loved the amazing way one of the primary thoughts of the perusing was the manner by which If you are composing an environmental change article then you should give arrangements. I feel this is significant supposing that one is simply expressing what we are fouling up and the outcomes of our activities and not expressing an answer, at that point we will in general get disheartened and proceed not act. I accept that nobody should feel better than the other with regards to battling the atmosphere emergency since this is an issue that we are for the most part confronting and we as a whole live on a similar earth. There is no opposition with regards to this issue since we either all keep the earth from pulverization, or we as a whole face the outcomes. I accept the arrangements he shared are a definitive objective of what we should impart to pass on logical proof that has been demonstrated by trustworthy associations and researchers so as to guarantee perception. Individuals need to comprehend this truly is an emergency that completely should be deflected, and it would just be through successful correspondence and the spreading of mindfulness that enough individuals could really see how grave the circumstance is, and ideally thus, follow up on it.

I found this week’s reading to be very powerful in communicating the effects of climate change and its significance to the most resistant and misinformed portion of our population, or Uncle Pete as the chapter, “Communicating Climate Change Science” refers to them. Unlike most of the other readings we have covered up until this point in the class, this chapter directly addresses the practical issues in translating the climate science into accessible and believable language for even the greatest of skeptics. I think, as this chapter addresses, when we find ourselves armed with a great deal of knowledge on the subject of climate change, our natural impulse is to tell anybody and everybody as much as we can on the subject. However, despite our good intentions, more often than not, the people who actively deny or remain skeptical about climate change and our contribution to it, are not often going to listen to a fact heavy and overwhelming lecture on climate change that may directly challenge one or more of the freedoms and liberties that the “Uncle Petes” of the world hold dear. While it makes sense to wait for our own Uncle Petes to come to us to ask questions, this poses a concern that I just can’t seem to easily resolve: With critical deadlines to enact change a major presidential election just days away, how can we possibly wait patiently in hopes that they will suddenly take an active interest in the climate and our relationship with it? 

         <br><br>

To be frank, my “Uncle Petes” are my own parents. Just this week, without meaning to even address the issue of climate change directly or start a political argument, I mentioned to my parents that I met Josh Hutcherson at the Bernie rally on campus. My parents only response was to ask, “So you’re a f***ing socialist now?” When met with such a response, it would seem that the answer is not to push further but to step back and wait for them to take an interest in the environmental issues that are a pivotal point of Bernie’s campaign (or any candidate that has placed environmental issues at the forefront of their campaign). But with so little time left, what realistically can we do? When time is of the essence and the Uncle Petes of the world are still not ready to talk, what are we to do? Should we still try our best to employ careful and respectful language, metaphors and other conversational tactics in a last ditch attempt to at least ensure that at the bare minimum: that Uncle Pete isn’t voting for Trump? 
         <br><br>


I personally cannot simply wait for their interest with such a significant voting cycle on the immediate horizon. All we can do between now and election day is be communicative, respectful and try our very best. So here’s hoping my own efforts to talk to my own Uncle Petes and your efforts to productively communicate with yours will not fall entirely on deaf ears.

What i found most interesting about this section was the bit on uncle phil. I like almost everyone (as the article suggests) have an uncle phil and it can be very frustrating to speak with him about this sort of subject. He gets his news from facebook or other untrustable sources, and is also told that anyone who says the contrary has been brainwashed. Because of this he can be very unresponsive to beliefs that are contrary to his. What I found most interesting is the reading perspective of listening to him and understanding his points, even when you know them to be untrue. 
         <br><br>
In listening, you give yourself a fighting chance to then have a civil conversation in which you can better address uncle Phil's points while trying to accommodate your information to address his doubts. Using correct language and some of the provided metaphors would be useful as well and i plan on using some of them in my next conversation with uncle phil.

Really enjoying the content of this class, and I appreciate the exposure Hiltner gives to so many climate forward acts. Like with freegans, I think this is good the he is explaining that cutting back ANY amount of your meat consumption is good. He reminds us that these life changes are not "all or nothing" and just because you can't cut chicken out of your diet, you can still cut out beef. Or even if you cant completely cut out beef, then cut it out a little bit. I think Hiltners way of being open to communicating with people who aren't vegans and who don't know about veganism. We shouldn't be mad at people who are unaware that their actions so negatively affect the environment. Being willing to explain can also help people think about changing their meat consumption.



</p><hr>


<p>
This was my favorite online lecture of Ken's! Very clear, thorough, and refreshing to hear such an open minded perspective that I feel a lot of people, especially vegetarians and vegans can learn from. Rather than categorizing yourself in one box that is often viewed out of reach and of higher power than the meat eating population this truly is a bridge that can lead people to eating healthier and being environmentally conscious.
         <br><br>
There is a lot of scientific psychology that backs up the strategy Ken and Summerville use and emphasize to help people become more environmentally friendly in their food choice. By not giving an all or nothing choice and rather showing that there are different levels to the climate crisis spectrum and that you can still make a positive impact by not being on the "extreme" end of it, the door is open for everyone to enter. I can personally say that I have eaten much less beef since I started this class, and now even when I do eat it, I feel slightly nauseated knowing I am eating an animal that was most likely not treated in a moral way, and that in the process of developing it into meat, used gallons of water that could have been saved. To me, vegetables, rice, and beans have physically tasted better because I have such strong background knowledge on what animal products due to the environment. I think by humbly educating people they are more inclined to see the movement as something in reach for them join, rather than an exclusive group. I want to continue spreading this awareness and believe conversation is the best way to do it. I think Summerville's descriptive solution to effective communication hit the nail on the head and is a very attainable realistic way to get climate activism and climate friendly habits to be embraced. Even if the extreme measures aren't attainable due to financial reasons, or inaccessibility, the small measures, like a simple food choice at dinner can add up and go a long way.

In comments I have previously made, specifically in the video focusing on Minimalism, I mentioned how hard it is for people to go vegan or make other changes because it seems like a very drastic change to make in our lifestyle. I agree that it should be made more obvious that it isn’t an “all or nothing” choice, but instead there is a spectrum. I certainly don’t think going cold turkey in regards to going vegan is a good idea, I think everyone can start by portioning/slowly cutting out the amount of meat one consumes in a day or in a week. It really is important to portray these lifestyle changes as attainable rather than out of reach or “holier than thou.” Portrayal and tone of information is extremely important especially when the topic, climate change, is a controversial one to some. I also agree on how financial problems may keep some from obtaining those extreme measures, but hopefully people are able to do what they can to help out our environment.

After reading this week’s text, “Communicating Climate Change Science”. I realize that the author is stating facts on how we should look at Climate Change. The author emphasizes the importance of Scientists and everyone else should improve their communication skills by considering their audience. This is really vital to our society because we tend to be influenced easily by anything that the media and the internet show us. I like the idea that we should be careful on how we are portraying Climate Change to society. Communication is key to understanding and spreading crucial information about Climate Change to society, knowing subject matter is crucial. Conversely, our previous lecture materials and readings illustrate the skepticism about the authority of the source of Climate Change. Personally, I understand the skepticism about Climate Change and it makes sense that communication skills are being suggested for society to hone. Hence, ‘Uncle Pete’. We all have an aspect from ‘Uncle Pete’ when it comes to skepticism. Uncle Pete is the missing gap between our ideas of suggested solutions to actually taking actions about it. I believe that if we manage to somehow convert these Uncle Pete (like our political leaders), we would be able to solve Climate Change.

I think that “Communicating Climate Change Science” made very effective arguments about how climate change surpassses being just a scientific issue, but also a moral and an ethical one. The example of the evangelical Christian, Katherine Hayhoe, comes to mind - when convincing people who may be creationists and fundamentalists, the most effective way to communicate the severity of the climate crisis is to give it to them in their own rhetoric. Scientific arguments may not resonate as well, but religious and moral ones may cause them to change their mindsets. Understanding your audience is such an important part of environmental activism, and it may be the key to bridging the generational gap over the issue as well. It is also important to fully understand the facts and data of the climate crisis because of the vast amount of misinformation about the issue there is circulating. When others who aren’t as informed about climate change argue that it’s not as big of an issue that scientists are making it out to be, the most effective way to refute their stance is with the facts.
         <br><br>
I also appreciated the “Uncle Pete” analogy, as it seems that it’s getting more and more common to hear from conservatives that the climate crisis is a “liberal hoax”, or something along those lines. It’s frustrating that scientific evidence holds no value to the Uncle Petes of the world, but the author is right in reminding us that having the patience and willingness to communicate with people like “Uncle Pete” and correct some of their biased beliefs may change their way of thinking.

I really appreciated this week’s reading as well as Ken’s video on it. Not only in regards to the climate crisis, I believe that communication is literally one of the most powerful and most underappreciated tools that someone can use. I think it’s just so important to be able to speak to others and actually have them listen to you: and this is done through clear, concise, respectful communication. I want to praise Ken for the way he teaches us about climate change; he does it clearly and effectively while being extremely objective, humble, and polite. So it was nice to have a segment dedicated to communication. 
         <br><br>

One of the biggest things we can do to combat the climate crisis is spreading awareness and information regarding it. By this point, 2020, lots of people know that climate change is happening or at the very least are aware of it being a big issue that is being talked about. However, many of them still only have a surface-level understanding of it. I was that way at the start of taking this class. Yes, the temperatures are rising and so are the sea levels and the ice caps are melting and it’s going to be terrible. But it would help climate activism and probably get more people politically involved if they knew more of the truths regarding climate change. For example, communicating to others the true extent of involvement by the fossil fuel industry, explaining the multitude of disasters that will befall the planet as greenhouse gas emissions go up, the massive amounts of instability, unrest, and chaos that climate migration would cause, etc. People need to understand that this really is a crisis that absolutely needs to be averted, and it would only be through effective communication and the spreading of awareness that enough people could truly understand how grave the situation is, and hopefully in turn, act upon it.

Compared with other articles that talk about the science of climate change, this article is funny and easy to understand. Even though it’s called the “Communicating Climate Change Science”, There are not much scientific terms but simple words, sentences, and vivid examples. The character Uncle Pete appears a lot of times in this chapter. He represents a bunch of people who doubt if the climate change is happening, arguing that there is not climate crisis, and believing that many climate falsehood and climate myths are true. Uncle Pete is the image of climate change deniers. They are stubborn and refuses to believe in the fact that the climate change is happening.What we need to do to mitigate climate change is learning how to deal with people like Uncle Pete, a denier who believe in the fallacy. Dealing with he climate crisis is not only a matter of person action, but persuade others join us.

Zhou, I agree with you that this article was funny, articulate, and much easier to understand than the other readings we have done in this class so far. “Communicating Climate Change Science” does not use scientific terms because it is trying to persuade us that climate change is real by using the techniques and strategies of communication it is trying to teach us. The article opens with a tip for anyone who is trying to communicate climate change, “use simple clear messages and repeat it often.” I noticed multiple times throughout the article where Sommerville is repeating the fact that “climate change is real” and “climate change is man-made.” These are all simple and effective words to form a sentence that is easily understandable to the public. I found the facts given throughout the article useful because I can use them to support my case whenever I discuss with my friends and family on the subject of climate change. What I found insightful and interesting in Ken’s video on the readings is that I should not be direct and bring up climate change at the beginning of a conversation. After thinking about this opinion, I agree that going off about climate change without any context or interest from your fellow peers is setting yourself up for failure. People do not want to hear about what you are doing in your life and how you are helping the environment because it will make them feel worse and give off the idea that you are “superior” to your friends and family that are not doing any personal acts to mitigate the climate change. I agree that we must persuade others to join us, but the people who want to join us must be influenced and inspired to be interested in participating in the first place. Ken offers very useful tactics to segway from being a vegetarian and a vegan to other topics that show how dedicated one is to the climate crisis. However, he makes a great point that we must walk the walk in order to talk the talk. If we claim to care about the environment but also waste a ton of food every meal, then who would believe us?  It is definitely hard and takes time, but fighting against the political and cultural views of the climate change in America will not happen overnight. It all starts locally but most importantly it starts with us. 
         <br><br>
Similar to you, I also found Uncle Pete as an important character to learn from and is a fictional character that represents many different people around the world that do not believe in climate change. I thought Sommerville’s examples and ways to counter the myths of climate change were very useful. He also brings up a good point as to why climate deniers refuse to implement policies that take us towards a path of reducing emissions. The most common response is that the government is making up climate change in order to set up more regulations and limit the freedoms of the people. This view is ridiculous on its own, but the underlying reasoning for this thought process is so that the wealthy who are profiting from greenhouse emissions can delay action. These people want to delay action so that they can profit for as long as possible. This is why communication is so important. We need to communicate the dangers of delaying and listening to these falsehoods that people are claiming in order to profit off of the demise of the human race.

As much as I enjoyed the readings for this week ("Bending the Curve") which I found full of great tips on how to communicate climate science to those who aren't trained in science lingo or overall skeptical of the very real climate crisis, I found this video to be rather aggravating. I'll start with the readings, because positives are better than negatives. The climate crisis has a scientific basis, and yet it is largely a cultural problem; chapter 8 of the readings pointed this out in a particularly poignant way: "I am convinced
          <br><br>
that confronting climate change is fundamentally a moral and ethical issue. It involves considerations of intergenerational equity." It is unequal that we, as a consumerist nation, rip the chance of a secure future from nations that are barely staying afloat as is. It is unequal that we, as a generation, are glorifying and participating in the behavior that is stealing a secure future from our children. It is unequal and unfair and frankly, infuriating that you, Ken, and your generation knew about the climate crisis and the issues at hand and did not mobilize to  impede the looming catastrophe. The climate crisis is a staggering issue that is fertilized and fed by power imbalances, and that is why I found your video on freeganism/climatarianism and veganism to be rather obnoxious. 

         <br><br>

I’m not going to argue that most people will not adopt a plant-based diet. As upsetting as it is, most people are willing to pay lip service to an idea only if they don’t have to change what they put in their mouth. As annoying as the terms “freegan” and “climatarian” are to me, this sort of viewpoint is more likely to be adopted by people who care about the environment without caring about many other social issues at all. I’ve anecdotally noticed a disconnect between people who are environmentally conscious and relatively wealthy and basically any other group experiencing systemic discrimination. I once got into an argument with someone who seemed to believe that solving the climate crisis would magically resolve every other issue our species has created: wealth gaps, racism, sexism, artificially created world hunger (since we do produce enough calories to feed our entire population, we just fail to distribute it). I’m bringing this experience up, and mentioned the inequality of the climate crisis, because it ties into why veganism is not a “fad”, it’s not “cool”, and I certainly think it will have more longevity than “freeganism” or “climatarianism”: it addresses the welfare of the environment, the welfare of the human race, and the welfare of animals. The three aspects should never be separated. 
         <br><br>

A well-planned vegan diet with in-season plants is the most environmentally sound diet possible. It requires less land for crops and grazing, it requires less water, and produces less emissions than any diet with animals in it. If people stopped eating cows, imagine how much more of the Amazon rainforest would still be around. If people ate less fish, imagine how much more of the deep-sea floor would be untouched by trawling. I won’t exhaust this issue, because we’ve spoken at length about the power of a plant-based diet in class and in previous videos and documentaries, but this is apparently the only acceptable reason to go vegan in some people’s eyes.
         <br><br>

A vegan diet absolutely addresses human welfare. It boggles my mind when people ask me what good deeds I’m doing for my fellow man. First of all, I don’t eat humans either. Jokes aside, veganism frees up land for people to live on, and for us to practice more sustainable agriculture on; with a sky-rocketing population such as ours, we need to figure out how to feed more and more people on increasingly limited land. Additionally, it is absolutely insane that we keep a global herd of over 1 billion cows, 1 billion pigs, and 23 billion chickens (!!!) when there are people who are starving. We take plant calories out of the mouths of the hungry and feed them to animals that are then eaten by the wealthiest people, exacerbating issues of human hunger and dietary emissions. It is criminal to have a food system set up like this, where we breed and feed a ridiculous number of livestock into existence when there are people in every single nation of the world who go hungry. Beyond that, slaughterhouse work is often traumatizing, and I don’t know why it wouldn’t be. Paying other people to go against their natural instincts to protect and care for other beings and instead kill them, matter of factly and in cold-blood, day in and day out, as a career, is absolutely horrendous. While produce farming isn’t faultless when it comes to treating workers, and I agree that the people who harvest our food deserve to do so in better conditions, with adequate pay, health care, and immigration protections, I’d argue that the conditions of work while harvesting food is simply another facet of how terrible unchecked capitalism is for the common worker. Fast fashion is terrible for factory laborers, but no one says to go naked as a viable alternative. Similarly, no one should advocate that we stop eating produce or stop being vegan or vegetarian because of the way farm workers are treated; instead, we need to organize, educate, and agitate until conditions improve. Finally, a vegan diet is optimal for health; I know that people will try to argue this point, but it is backed by decades of studies: saturated fat and animal protein (inseparable aspects of mammal flesh) are slowly killing those who eat it. I’d recommend reading “Proteinaholic” by Garth Dennis, M.D. for an informative and often funny read that is chock full of scientific evidence in support of this fact. It may not make you go vegan, but it’ll convince you to eat an apple instead of beef jerky. 
         <br><br>

As for the issue that pisses people off the most, a vegan diet promotes animal welfare. As I wrote in the paragraph above, our global herd of livestock is unbelievably large. These animals are brought forcibly into the world, often through artificial insemination and no natural instincts on the part of the parents, only to be placed in horrible conditions of factory farms and fed a cocktail of hormones and cheap grain to grow as fast as possible, then sent to the slaughterhouse in overpacked trucks long before their natural death date or kept alive in crippling pain for as long as possible, being exploited for their milk, eggs, wool, and reproductive capabilities. It’s monstrous. Our treatment of animals, kind to some species and the overlords of others, encapsulates everything that is wrong with our species. Raising this herd consumes so much of the resources that we value: food, water, land. It is morally wrong to deny members of our own species and turn around and breed more animals into existence instead. Furthermore, why do we mourn the loss of some species and yet abuse others? We are in the sixth extinction; we are making the planet uninhabitable for us, yes, and almost all other species as well. This is another issue of inequity within the climate crisis: a coral reef will never acidify the ocean, no Amazonian bird or spider will build a smokestack, polar bears don’t melt the Arctic ice. We acknowledge the tragedy of our actions toward animals in these aspects, but we evidently cannot confront the fact that we collectively exploit some species for no reason other than taste pleasure. Combating the climate crisis is going to take a cultural revolution; as stated in the readings, it is a moral and cultural issue beyond anything else. We need to implement sweeping reforms on the things we buy, the way we get around, where and how we live, and what we eat. Climatarianism seems like a hand-holding, band-aid solution to a larger issue of devaluing other living things on this planet. If we are going to change society from the ground up, we should change this aspect of animal exploitation too.
         <br><br>

Too long, didn’t read: climatarianism and reducitarianism don’t address the root of exploitation and power imbalances in our food system, in contrast to the ways we plan on addressing economics, housing, and transportation. Veganism does; like a living tree, the aspects of environmentalism, animal and human welfare cannot be separated or reduced. Challenging the climate crisis requires people to relearn how to live; this societal alteration shouldn’t suddenly stop at the dinner table, and veganism is only as scary, challenging, or unsatisfying as you make it.

This was one of my favorite readings of the course so far. The chapter was written in a way that educated the reader on climate change science while educating the reader as to how to effectively communicate climate change science. I learned a tremendous amount about climate science and facts, but I also learned several clear and successful communication principles. For example, I learned to never commit the sin of “burying the lead.” Instead, one should give their lead in the first sentence of a story in a way that captures the reader’s attention but still motivates the reader to keep reading. I was also fascinated by the clear power of stories and metaphors when trying to communicate climate change science. These strategies will translate to communication in all fields of study. Lastly, I found the six guidelines given in the “Solutions” section of the chapter to be simple and very effective. All six are concrete and extremely important, but also very easy to comprehend. Anyone can comprehend these six principles and they are a great example of communicating to one’s audience.

While I don't think this was my favorite reading in the course so far, I believe it has been one of the more useful ones that gives us practical ways to communicate all of the ideas that we've learned in the class thus far. You mentioned how the reading talked about "burying the lead" , I don't think most of us will be writing a scientific journal about our findings on climate change or presenting our ideas on the subject. I wasn't as enthusiastic about many of the topics in this chapter as you were. However, even though there were some things in this chapter that I feel don't apply to the mass majority of people, there were also so many things that will help if I ever do find myeslf in a situation where I'm talking to a climate change denier. I believe I mentioned this in a comment on last weeks movie, but a few weeks ago the topic of climate change got brought up and instantly he talked about how it was stupid and how the climate changes naturally. I just dismissed it because I didn't want to go against his beliefs. Now,  I know exactly what to say and how to say it when supporting my own beliefs on climate change and I don't need to just brush off other deniers.

This week's reading was rather useful for me personally, as the "Uncle Pete" in my life is, unfortunately, my own father. There have been countless times where we have discussed the climate crisis during dinner time, where I will either argue with him until my face turns beet red or I give up and stop discussing the matter altogether. Somerville brought up the strong point that medical doctors do not have to establish their credibility as climate scientists do, and most of the time people do not question the opinions of doctors. Despite this, the climate crisis can still be communicated in an effective way, and I truly appreciated the advice that Somerville gave. Use of anecdote, metaphor, and having information on-hand for the most common misconceptions about climate change are easily some of the best pieces of advice I've received about communicating the climate crisis, which gives me hope for the next time the Uncle Petes in my life want to get riled up about climate change.
         <br><br>
I also genuinely appreciated Ken's approach to talking about diet/lifestyle changes amongst people who are more openminded/realistic about climate change. It can be rather offputting to others if someone is told what to do/what to eat, so announcing a diet that is different than the regular, American omnivorous diet is not always wise. I've never heard the term "climatarian" until now, but I definitely agree that it draws people in and gets a conversation going. I believe that no one should feel better than the other when it comes to fighting the climate crisis because this is a problem that we are all facing and we all live on the same earth. There is no competition when it comes to this issue because we either all prevent the earth from destruction, or we all face the consequences.

I find Ken’s video very helpful and objective for the method he mentioned when he used Meditation. He claimed himself not as climate Crisis first and not as vegan first when his friends ask him. He said himself as a climate promoter or freegan instead of a simply vegan. This method can easily open up a conversation and people’s interests on this topic. For most of people, especially in our generations, it is easy to give them right. Options and shape them. Therefore, we’d better act now.

I really enjoyed the reading this week and how it was presented. This chapter used different stories and metaphors to inform the public about the environmental issues at hand. I found this approach interesting because usually authors rely too much on scientific facts. When authors use scientific facts it can sometimes be hard for readers to understand. This article presented the information in a way for anyone to be able to understand it. I believe more articles need to focus on doing this because most people aren’t as educated on the issue as we assume. This chapter presented options for the readers to take to ultimately help resolve the climate crisis. With this being said, it was nice being able to read an article that focused on optimism. It allowed me to gain hope unlike the other readings we have been assigned. I liked how Ken also mentioned that this is a human issue instead of a scientific one. We are ultimately the ones who are going to be affected in the long run, so it is our issue. Overall, I believe climate activists should take inspiration from this article and realize that we need to spread information that is easy to understand. This is the only way we will be able to get a majority of people educated enough to want to make a change.

In the reading material “Communicating Climate Change Science”, we are told five key elements to convince people about negative effects of climate change-preparation, stories, metaphors, languages and solutions. These five elements are essential for convincing people. Without these five, it is almost impossible to pursue people like my mum. At the Earth Day, I asked my mum to shut the power down for an hour to protect the environment. To my surprise, my mum said a bunch of things to refuse the truth that shutting the power down will help the environment. This time, I am hoping with the help of the five elements, my mum can get to realize the significance of global warming.

This week’s reading was incredibly helpful to me in understanding and hopefully combatting the frustration I often feel in discussing climate change with people outside of my close peers and student body. Knowing how to communicate what we learn in this class and spread awareness of this issue is, in my opinion, the MOST important lesson Ken could give us. There may be 800 students in this class, most of whom (not all I’m sure) do not need to be convinced of facts like the 12 points on climate change contained in the reading. But there are dissenters in every room, and this campus alone has hundreds of thousands of students — guaranteeing that even among this liberal college-educated group of young people there are plenty who remain skeptical. Not every UCSB student will take this class during their college experience, and (for the moment, ignoring the website that contains this course), anyone who doesn’t attend UCSB has no access to this curriculum at all. While acknowledging that the website and these Youtube videos are fantastic and can reach a vast audience, the most significant work we as students can do is to take what we’ve learned in this class and communicate it to others who don’t believe in climate change or are unwilling to support this cause. If each of us can successfully master the ability to convince people that these statements are true and help them understand the climate crisis, there is no limit to the amount of change in public opinion we can accomplish: as this action has a compounding effect. This basic understanding and awareness of climate change is what will convince people to take the time to discover and engage with resources like Ken’s website, educate themselves, make lifestyle changes and combat the crisis. Arguably, the hardest part of this process that I’ve experienced is acceptance of the first 2 points of the IPCC report: “[The Earth] is warming,” and “It’s us.” This is where many people in the public are stuck, and many climate change believers, including myself, wouldn’t know how to talk someone past this hurdle effectively. As the reading explains, the distrust people have for the massive amounts of data supporting these two statements is because people “have no idea how such facts were discovered.” The perceived gap between the average person and scientists, the prevalence of myths and lies spread under the guise of science, the lack of understanding and insight into the workings of the scientific work behind studying climate change — these all contribute to the existence of “Uncle Pete’s” who doubt science to the point of disbelief in the two fundamental points about climate change. It’s up to us as those privileged enough to have been educated on this topic, passionate enough to try to raise awareness in another, and numerous enough to do this on a grand scale, to be able to communicate about the climate crisis in an effective way.

The reading this week has been my favorite so far. I think that communication is a key issue in the climate crisis we are facing now, and being aware of effective communication skills can help to reach the general public. There is little good if you are aware of the crisis we are facing if you are not sure on how to spread the science in an effective approach that the public will respond to. I think that "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" laid out a very realistic situation regarding "Uncle Pete". We all know people in our lives that do not believe in climate change and spit the same "facts" about why it is not an issue. I thought that all the points this reading brought up are very common issues people run into when talking to people like this. For example, when it mentioned that Uncle Pete overall has an issue with accepting climate change because of the federal regulation it could result in, I remember having a conversation with a friend who's uncle (yes, very ironic) had argued against climate change after she made him read "Merchants of Doubt", with his ending point basically not refuting the science but the government involvement it would create. 
         <br><br>

I think that this reading does an extremely good job of explaining how to effectively communicate the issue of climate change. It encourages us to educate ourselves, admit when we are unaware on a topic, and has good strategies on how to refute the claims made by climate deniers. I think one of the most useful metaphors that stuck with me after the reading was the part on medical science. Most of the population today does not refute what medical experts tell us, and take their advice at high regards. Unlike medical experts, climate scientists do not have this same relationship with the general public and are constantly critiqued, even though they are the experts on the subject. I think that if we are going to make progress regarding climate change, that experts and those that believe in the climate crisis, need to become expert communicators and learn how to reach the general public and raise their awareness in the most effective way.

Hi, I completely agree with your statement about communication and how it can help bring awareness to the general public. Communicating about a problem like climate change has been a long process filled with several challenges. Communities and people come to better understand climate change  through effective communication from other individuals. While the basics of it are well known, people don't know what to do next. Opinions are divided and beliefs are challenged. That is why creating an efficient and well planned strategy is important in bringing about change in the general publics' perspective

<p>
One of the most stand-out ideas that I took from both my reading of chapter 8 as well as my viewing of Ken’s video was definitely the idea of climate change activism: specifically, the diet-based lifestyle changes of veganism and vegetarianism, having been a cultural punch-line for what felt like decades. Though I have commented on this idea in previous videos, I feel like it is worth mentioning again due mostly in part to the fact that a great number of people needed to deal with decades of harassment and general rudeness in order to normalize a lifestyle for any old drunk uncle to understand. 
         <br><br>
 Though, as the chapter states, a lot of emphasis for combating climate change should rightly be put on convincing people that climate change exists in its form in the first place, there is still room to convince people that, as we have been talking about, lifestyle changes are the best place to seek the change we need in order to combat climate change. So then, why have so many of those obvious  lifestyle changes been bastardized and, whether in the past or still, turned into what seems like a pop-culture punchline?
         <br><br>
 I think it is because part of communicating the importance of climate change science has to do with the fact that the solutions involve an admittance of compliance with such a global problem: an admittance that is very hard for many.




</p><hr>


<p>
I really liked the organization of concepts in Chapter 8 in "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions".  The purpose of the chapter was clear, and the authors did an effective job of delivering the content in a simple yet powerful manner. 
         <br><br>


In 8-1, I found the 12 points of climate changes impact to be very useful. These statements are backed by extensive research, as stated in the article, and can be useful to bring up when debating with or explaining to someone. Statements such as "the ice is melting" and "CO2 absorbed by the ocean makes them more acidic" are irrefutable and simple for others to understand. They are also easy to discuss if needed. 

         <br><br>

In 8-2 I found the Uncle Pete "myths and falsehoods" to be very helpful as well. When trying to be an effective climate crisis communicator, it is important to anticipate what non-believers may say in response to you. Expecting these responses and preparing answers to them that are backed by evidence and research well help solidify your argument. 

         <br><br>

In 8-3, the metaphors stated in the chapter were easy to understand and relate to. By comparing the effects of climate change to concept that is commonly understood in society removes the "black-box" behind the impacts.

It’s very surprising hearing Ken lecture on the fact that there's a greater impact on conserving food that would’ve been thrown away than to go vegetarian. The fact that this essentially shows how much food is being thrown away each day is disturbing. As a first world country, it is our responsibility to set an example for the rest of the world. We cannot continue to do the things we are now doing and not expect a huge negative impact on the planet. The book Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions is an amazing read that many should consider reading. It portrays the urgency we must take to slow down climate change if we want to leave a habitable Earth behind for future generations.

this week's reading was very easy to read, which was nice. It also was one of my favorites so far because it was so relatable. It was just what the doctor ordered. We all have that 'uncle pete' in our lives and the author set out guidelines about how to perfectly rebut and communicate with pete how he is wrong without getting into a pissing match. all you gotta do is lay out the facts in a simple manner that pete cannot argue with. I have personally had many arguments with republicans that deny climate change to try to convince them otherwise. as the author said, uncle pete's in the world do not like to be told by liberals that they are wrong. they just want to keep on watching their fox news and believing lies. i think they know it as well. i cant believe this is still a political issue... because it's not. its an issue that effects all lifeforms on earth, now and more importantly, into the future. it was interesting learning how killer of a human Ken is in this video. i have always liked the guy, but up until now he has not told us quite the extent to which he devotes his life to the climate crisis. i guess thats why this class ended up being so well put together. i also agree with Ken that putting yourself out there as a 'climatarian' instead of a vegan is much more interesting for people that you are dining with. anyone would agree that being a climatarian is good, and it is just up to them about how far they want to take it aka cutting out all meat vs just eating turkey.

<p>
What I got from this week’s reading is that we must be more well informed on the science behind climate change and spread our knowledge to others who are unaware of the detrimental effects we are causing. We must be able to fully understand all of the science and support our claims with scientific evidence and adequately communicate our points in order to provide more effectiveness. You must always anticipate counterarguments and that applies for any topic you plan on arguing. This is so you can refute them with support which endorses the credibility of your own argument. 
         <br><br>
For climate change, a very common counterargument that deniers like to bring up is that the weather pattern changes are due to the natural rotation of the earth. But Veerabhadran Ramanathan, Roger Aines and Max Auffhammer discuss that, “The orbital changes have much too small an effect to produce the observed large warming that has occurred in recent decades.” The authors use their own scientific findings, ability to effectively communicate, and automatic credibility of their job titles, scientists, to adequately relay their proof of the existence of climate change and how it is caused predominantly by humans. 
         <br><br>
I think this is a very important skill for everyone to have, communication skills, and for us enrolled in this course especially. We are now well informed about the topic of climate change while many people in this world are not. We are  all now obligated to spread the message that we must act now in order to save our planet. We are also young and may struggle with convincing adults of the facts of climate change and the urgency involved in reversing it. So, this article was very important for us to understand how to spread our knowledge effectively.

I agree with you Maya. From this reading this week it really solidified by opinion about how I want to be one of the people spreading climate change awareness and issues not the one doing the science. Yes, I think it is important the science is important but this data as mentioned has been around for decades and there have been propaganda campaigns to confuse the public. I see myself as the one who helps scientists convey messages to the public to counteract the will of the fossil fuel industry. I want to be the one fighting for policy changes or the one writing them. From this reading, I too have gained some advice about conveying the climate crisis to the public and what we can do about it. 
          <br><br>
One thing we can do is know the facts and if asked something we don’t know admit it. Otherwise this can hurt our claims down the road. Use stories to engage readers and also implement facts so that your argument is strong and convincing. Also if you are having a tough time discussing the climate crisis you can use metaphors to make the more convincing/understandable to the public. Some of these useful metaphors include the physician or an athlete on steroids. As for language, limit jargon and use words that the public would know and start with the result or main idea first and then back it up afterward. This is done so that you do not “bury the lead”. Make sure to include solutions so people are not turned off. Finally, don’t impose lifestyle changes on your friends, wait for them to ask and it will be more effective long term.

This was probably my favorite reading so far! It was fun to read and pretty interesting, it felt like something anyone could read. Just as professors and teachers can trick you on a multiple choice test question, any article or "fact" can by switching a few ambigous words. An easy fall leads to an easy conversion to believe that climate change is not occuring because of human action. When talking to others back home about climate crisis, it always seems to be all the younger kids arguing with the elders about it. The one thing they have over us is the stupid comeback: "I am older and wiser than you". Like...just because you're "older and wiser" doesn't mean the Earth is not dying. I think communicating in a more respectful manner really is the first step. If someone is not willing to hear what someone says then what's the point of saying anything in the first place. I hope Ken talks more about this article because it really was a great one, and i think the communication aspect of the climate crisis may be the most important.

I think your word choice, of communicating in a more respectful manner is interesting. In this case, I’m not sure I’d say individuals are being disrespectful when speaking to other about the climate, but rather not speaking to them in a humble manner. This accusatory mindset can potentially be problematic when trying to spread more facts concerning the climate crisis. I agree that “If someone is not willing to hear what someone says then what's the point of saying anything in the first place”. We should not forget that we need to make sure that alienation does not occur, as this should not be a divisive issue. Telling everyone to adopt strict lifestyle adjustments immediately may not be realistic, as people may feel attacked, but rather acting in a manner which promotes self-reflection would be best for the long-term success of this movement.

Yes! I definitely agree that this text was easy to read and clear for every type of audience. I love how this text was mainly focusing on how we should communicate the importance of being aware of climate change with simplicity and directness, specifically how to have a civic conversation with climate change deniers. Just  how the text explained that everyone knows an “Uncle Pete”, who doesn’t believe in climate change because he fears that the government will get too involved and we’ll lose all of our freedoms. I have noticed that the people I have encountered, so far, who believe climate change is a hoax or natural, are older people. It is really hard to convince older people that they’re wrong or that they’re being too close-minded, not only about climate change but about many other stuff as well. However, after this reading I learned that we need to change the way we talk about climate change to them. Hard numbers and charts can scare some people, so using metaphors, stories, and simple language is more likely to help climate change advocates reach more people and help them understand their point of view. Furthermore, I liked how towards the end of the reading the author was being optimistic and included some positive changes that are occurring around the world to fight climate change. If we try to be this positive when communicating with others about climate change, I feel like people will be more willing to listen to us.



<br><hr>
I also felt like this was something literally anybody could just read! There wasn't really anything ambiguous or vague or just completely incomprehensible in this text, which I feel is really good for reaching a wider audience. I also get what you're saying about how often times it is the younger generation going head to head with the older ones about climate change. Half of the time it's very difficult to talk to elders and change their mind specifically because of the excuse that you said they use. If it's not that, then talking to them in a certain way makes it easy for them to dismiss the subject and instead view you as disrespectful to them. Hopefully this article will help all of us take another step towards changing other generations' minds about climate change.

I totally agree that a first and very important step in addressing the climate crisis is being able to discuss it in a respectful manner. I have found myself trying to communicate these concerns with older family members, and a lot of the time it turns into a heated discussion. I feel like those who try to communicate the dangers of climate change are more often than not very passionate about the topic, and it becomes easier for them to get frustrated with those that don’t seem so understand or share their beliefs. And when the conversation starts to get heated, it honestly doesn’t allow for a productive outcome, and both parties are just left frustrated and unwilling to become more open minded. I also found it interesting how Ken talked about letting people come to you with curiosity instead of bringing issues up on your own. I totally saw where he was coming from when he talks about people shutting down a conversation when the whole “veganism” thing comes up. I’ve even seen this appear on social media as memes. I too personally have gotten frustrated with people because I felt like they were shoving it down my throat that they were a vegan and I was not, and that made me a bad person. It’s become clear to me that communication plays such a key role in this issue.

In terms of this week's readings, I found the concept of "Uncle Pete" to be not only very intriguing, but also that it made the reading far more relatable as I definitely have an Uncle Pete in my life when it comes to talking about climate change. I've tried a few times to bring up topics related to climate change to different members of my family, however when it comes to my grandpa, this is extremely difficult as he has stated multiple times that climate change just "isn't real". Due to the fact that he is very strong in his beliefs, and I don't want to get into an argument with my very old grandfather, I often stray away from talking about climate change, or any political issue, with him, though I've also often wished I could find a way to communicate with him in a sensible way about this serious issue. For this reason, I found this week's reading to be extremely useful as it provided ways to talk about climate change with even the most closed-minded individuals, such as my grandpa. I honestly had never really thought about using storytelling or metaphors to communicate climate change issues, and though I feel like neither is the most effective tool in my case, I can see how they could be extremely effective in their own ways. For me, the most useful tools provided by the reading were first, knowing your audience and why climate change is important to them, as well as the language portion which talks about what kind of language and information to use in order to best reach your target audience. Hopefully, if I can explain to my grandpa why climate change will drastically effect the lives of his family members such as his grandchildren and our children, as well as providing supported facts, he'll see why it is such an important issue. Though I'm not entirely sure if I will bring up climate change directly to him and try to change his beliefs, if the topic comes up I now definitely feel more comfortable with the idea of communicating to him that climate change is real, is happening now, and that there are ways in which we can and need to make changes in order to fight against it.

The reading for this week, “Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions” was a refreshing change of pace in my opinion. Especially in contrast to the article we began the course with, David Wallace-Wells’ “Uninhabitable Earth” which was extremely alarmist and pessimistic, this week’s reading seemed particularly optimistic and hopeful. Furthermore, an emphasis was placed on the importance of educating the general public about climate change which also seems like the most effective and straightforward way to combat the rampant misinformation intentionally spread by corporations that stand to benefit from a fossil fuel economy which we touched upon earlier in the course. I completely agree that when trying to convince a general public with facts, the way the information is presented is actually of the utmost importance. In other words, the information and the facts must be specifically framed to be easily understandable and convincing without sacrificing the integrity of the research and accuracy of the information. I could relate to this message on a personal level because as a researcher in STEM, when it’s time to present our research at a conference, we are often told to prepare multiple presentations: one for the experts in the field of your research, one for other STEM specialists, another for the general public, and if relevant, yet another version of the presentation that is more accessible for a younger audience.

Hi Catherine, I definitely agree with your response. Rather than using the alarmist approach that Wallace-Wells, this article communicated solutions to the audience using a very straightforward, yet cohesive and unbiased approach. To me, this is more valuable and appealing to read because providing solutions gives us hope that we can revert the crisis, rather than scaring us into doing it. The way we communicate and present information in today's society is very important because of how fast it spreads as well as how important this topic specifically is. Oftentimes, things are misconstrued in the media because of the way people present their information. Sometimes, it also escalates, becoming a big problem in the media. But if we are more direct and straightforward about sensitive topics, it would relieve society of this overwhelming struggle.

This reading and lecture combo has been one of my favorites yet. As Ken pointed out in the lecture today, if everyone was taught about climate science, the green new deal, and self-interest fossil fuel corporations, many more would probably be proactive towards climate change. All of us in this class chose it to learn more about climate change, for others who are skeptical or just don’t care, it's much harder to convince them to sit through a 10-week course on this crisis. I agreed with a lot of what the reading had to say about communicating. People hate to be wrong, they hate having their core ideas challenged, and they never want to back down in arguments. It requires careful and tactical communication to truly change someone's opinion. You have to open the person to the idea of change, then walk them through what they didn’t understand, and let them realize and form a new opinion. You can’t force it on them, they have to figure it out on their own without feeling stupid. Using stories that evoke empathy, or metaphors that provide new outlooks, are both great ways to present the topic in a newer fashion. In my mind, if you can get someone to think, “huh I guess I’ve never seen it like that before, maybe I should put more research into this,” then you are totally on the right track. To do this though, we need to learn communication skills. In addition, Ken talks about communicating to friends and non-skeptics about increasing proactiveness towards the crisis. I think Ken makes a very good point about letting the topic come up naturally. If one is over-enthusiastic about the climate, it could come off like they are trying to feel superior. Ken’s example of veganism vs climatarian is a very good one. The number one stereotype about vegans is that they won’t stop talking about it. If you try to convince people to stop eating poorly for the climate from the vegan angle, many will associate it with that stereotype. In contrast, explaining climatarism might get people who already believe in climate change thinking about what they can do to improve their diet. One important way of communicating climate activism is through action. If one lives the lifestyle, and their actions can back their words. Overall, I believe that learning to communicate the climate crisis is one of the most valuable ways to combat the climate crisis.

I agree with you that tactical communication is much needed in order to change other peoples' opinions. I found this week’s reading more encouraging than the other readings that we have done so far in this class. I found the five categories that can be used to aid the communication of climate change science really helpful in that each chapter broke down each topic and informed the readers on how they could take actions in certain situations. For example, the first chapter, which focuses on preparation, gave readers important and reliable facts that can be utilized in presenting the issue of the climate crisis to others. The second section focused more on the utilization of stories in order to convince people who deny climate change that climate change is in fact real, and it is something that should be acted upon now. This section introduces the character Uncle Pete, a person who completely denies and disagrees with the idea of the climate crisis. For people like Uncle Pete, using stories is probably the most effective way to communicate and can help get both the storyteller and the listener on the same page that climate change is an issue that we need to face head on. The third section focuses on how we can use metaphors as a way to convey the issue of the climate crisis. The metaphor that stood out to me the most in this section was the metaphor that calls carbon dioxide “the steroids” of our climate. This metaphor effectively demonstrates that even the smallest amounts of CO2 can make immensely large effects to the atmosphere and climate. The fourth section talks about the language that we can use to help others better understand the climate crisis. For people who haven't taken a class that focuses on the climate crisis or who aren’t as passionate about the topic, it may be hard to understand the vocabulary and words that climate activists use in their facts and information. This barrier in communication may make it more difficult to inform other people and may prevent at least a mutual understanding between climate activists and those who do not believe that the climate crisis is something that we need to worry about.  By explaining things in simpler and easier to understand terms, other people who oppose the climate crisis are more likely to understand climate activists' viewpoints. The last section in this chapter addresses the “Solutions” that we can take in order to help solve the climate crisis. This section tells the readers the political barriers that climate activists face, but can overcome, by reducing emissions, eating a more plant based diet, and by becoming politically active. This chapter provides readers with hope for the future and presents us all with the preparations we need to make a change.

I am so excited about this week's reading as well as Ken's introduction to it (I can financially say I am a climatarian, and it's so good to know that Ken took years to become a vegan). They are both so useful, giving some really practical suggestions. First of all, the chapter from Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions provides really comprehensive information on how to build our language and communication strategies around climate issues. I especially enjoy reading Uncle Pete's portion as he is depicted so vividly as an anti-climate change person. I feel more prepared after reading those claims and know how to properly respond back with facts and evidence. Another thing I found pretty useful was the "language" part. It points out the importance of word choice and how a single word can be twisted in meaning and lead to bias and misinformation. 

          <br><br>

Nevertheless, the most useful part I discovered was Ken's video! The vegan part is just so relatable. Before joining this class, I don't even connect "vegan" much with the moral side of it. I thought vegetarianism has mostly to do with a healthy diet, and people who want to lose weight. Isn't that crazy? Luckily, now I give my full respect to those who are concerned about our environment and become a vegetarian. I hope that someday in the future I can join them. I see Ken's strategy -- insisting in actions and showing commitment and waiting for others to ask -- can actually work. It not only can be effective but also very encouraging for me. I was actually feeling rejected after I heard the line "don't call yourself an environmentalist if you eat meat." However, when I eat at dining halls and grocery shopping with my friend, I pay attention to the ingredients and carefully eat less meat and make sure that I don't waste any food. And I found myself starting to communicate with my friend about my food choice and other climate-related things taught in our class. Though my actions are far from drastic, I am taking steps little by little, and I believe anyone can start those little steps and shouldn't feel rejected.

I agree that it is really comforting to know that even Ken took years to become fully vegan, as I eventually want to be vegan, but I don’t feel as though it is feasible right now due to my lack of money and time. Nonetheless, I have fully cut out beef from my diet and I will never re-introduce it (I never eat lamb either). I attempt to get my nutrients from plants whenever possible, and I will continue to cut down my consumption of animal products until, hopefully, I reach full veganism. But, for now, I would also consider myself a climatarian, and while it may not be as helpful as veganism, I believe it is better than nothing. I also think that climatarianism is a great “introduction” to changing food consumption habits, especially for those who may feel rejected from the environmentalist community simply because they are not vegan. It allows for more diet flexibility, without being so strict that people shy away from the diet entirely. 
           <br><br>

I think that one of the biggest things we can do related to food consumption (other than cut out animal products) is to reduce food waste as much as possible. At the dining halls on campus, one change was made a few years ago that cut food waste in HALF: getting rid of trays. This kept people from piling tons of dishes on their tray, instead only grabbing what they could hold and could actually finish eating. I think another thing that limits food waste at the dining halls is the small portion sizes, which allows us to get multiple foods without leaving each dish half unfinished. The dining halls have limited food waste from 6oz per person per meal to about 3oz per person per meal through these small and simple changes. Thinking about how many people eat at the dining halls daily, we have significantly cut down food waste, thus helping the environment. Furthermore, the food waste that is still created is composted, allowing some of the nutrients to return to our earth. I feel like this is a good example on how even small, completely painless changes to everyday living can contribute immensely to our fight against climate change. 
           <br><br>

Thinking about the “Uncle Pete’s” that I have come across in my life, I have to agree that this week’s reading might be one of my favorites. While it didn’t provide direct solutions toward climate change, I think one of the most effective things that we can do as climate activists is spread change to those around us, and this reading showed us exactly how. Whenever I have tried to argue an “Uncle Pete” in the past, I am often left frustrated and unsatisfied with the outcome of the discussion. When people have their mind set on what they believe to be the truth, it is immensely difficult to help them see otherwise, and sometimes I get so frustrated that my argument no longer feels strong or valid or factual, but purely emotional. It honestly gives me anxiety to try to argue or debate someone on any topic, making communication difficult and making the point I’m trying to get across get lost. Sometimes when you try to bring up something you are passionate about, it can backfire and actually be more problematic than positive. People may start to get impatient, and thus just try their best to make you wrap up your little speech as quick as possible, rather than actually listening to what you're saying. We must take a gentle approach to educating those who are ignorant toward this crisis, because directly treating them as ignorant or uneducated will only further upset them and cause them to WANT to go against what you're saying, or they may simply disregard your words entirely. This reading provided tips on how to better educate those who may be ignorant toward this issue without making them feel belittled.


<br><hr>
You shouldn’t feel dejected just because you don’t completely remove meat from your diet. Small changes also help and anyone who says otherwise is just gatekeeping and doing the opposite of motivating others. Ken’s strategy really is great because people will be much more open to conversation when they start it. Shoving your opinions down someone’s throat is a good way to get ignored. I also think it’s great how he tells them about the impact of different meats rather than going straight for the vegetarian or vegan options. It shows people that he doesn’t look down on them for not eating vegetarian or vegan options.

While I often have high praise to give on the material Ken provides us in this course, I must say "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" didn't strike much interest to me. While I am all for rewriting the narrative of climate change and inventing new ways to approach the conversation towards the climate crisis, I found this piece to be common sense. Similar to as the chapter mentioned, your argument should be based around the audience you are presenting your information to, and this course is directed at college students who should hopefully already have a complete understanding of political savviness. Therefore, I feel as though my time would of been better invested further researching alternative solutions to help solve the climate crisis rather than learning about how to approach it in conversation. When starting a discussion with "Uncle Pete", at least in my case, I know the way to articulate my argument in the hopes of better educating my relatives about the urgency and harsh reality of the climate crisis. If I'm talking to someone my age, I would formulate an argument using terms comprehendible to them, however if talking to someone elder I would try to make my point understandable but use an elevated form of articulation to prove I'm knowledgable on the subject while encouraging their response to my comments. Every political conversation should be held without emotional ties involved, seeing as emotion often takes away from the facts of the situation and leads to things getting heated fast. Which is why it is also important to hear the opposing side and listen to "Uncle Pete's" opinion even if it is complete garbage. When approaching these usually "hard to have" conversations, one needs to ensure it is a conversation not a lecture because no one wants to be lectured on something when trying to prove their point. All of this I knew before reading the piece, considering the importance of creating an encouraging environment to hold these political discussions to open the conversation to all perspectives despite any prevalent bias. While this could be due to the way I was raised, or my experience in the education system, I felt as though this was a topic everyone taking this course should of already been aware of before entering college. However, I will give Ken credit because while  reading through the comments a lot of my peers hadn't considered the importance of formulating a reasonable argument which means this lecture served an important narrative on how to approach any discussion that has political ties. Thus in retrospect I believe this material was necessary to start the conversation of how to formulate an open discussion on the climate crisis, and hope that this lecture can encourage everyone to share their knowledge learned in this class with their "Uncle Pete" next time a family dinner occurs.

After watching the video, I strongly agree with what Somerville has stated on "uncle Pete" about the climate crisis. Ken also indicated the term of personal change which I believed it might occur first so that it can better influence other people. As for metaphor which Somerville has mentioned, it could play an important role in analogies in underscore the effect of greenhouse gas emissions which he has discussed in the representation of Co2. Because of these metaphors, we could let our friends or family have a better understanding through the great living lifestyle.
           <br><br>

What's more, I believe the communication skill is extremely important in the situation of climate change. For example, public speaking could be one of the most effective ways to discuss with others if we want to see real changes. Overall, I think Ken's suggestions are very practicable.

I really liked this reading because it touched upon the fact that sometimes, the issues of climate change may not be communicated very effectively. I appreciated when the author said that “Climate change is much more than a scientific topic. I am convinced that confronting climate change is fundamentally a moral and ethical issue.” I completely agree with this statement and believe that ethics and personal values must be incorporated into our discussion of climate change rather than just scientific facts and numbers. The author used the example of Katherine Hayhoe, who is a climate scientist and an evangelical Christian. She is able to explain climate change effectively to so many Christians because she understands their values and can explain the moral ethics of fighting climate change to people who hold the same religious beliefs. 
           <br><br>

I think it is beneficial when people incorporate their personal beliefs into their stance on climate change. Sometimes the topic of climate change can seem dry because of the multitude of statistics and numbers and percentages that we are faced with when attempting to understand it. Yes, these numbers are important, but in order to achieve an understanding among the general public, human thoughts and emotions are essential. Discussing the morals of acting against climate change will help many people to feel and recognize its importance.

I really enjoyed this reading. I have been questioning how to most effectively communicate about this issue for long time. In the piece I felt as if each section really spoke to me.
            <br><br>

Preparation: when one talks about a controversial issue, or any issue for that matter you should be prepared before diving into an issue. You need to know your facts, because if you don’t or are unreliable, or state a fact that false you will lose credibility and no one will want to listen to the other points that you make, even if they are completely valid. They will continue to doubt you because of the rare wrong fact. The piece also mentioned that in preparation you have to think about your audience. This is true on so many levels, you aren’t going to have the same conversation with a climate change denier, as you are with a fellow activist that believes that cutting out meat has a bigger impact than driving car. You have to think about your audience. 
            <br><br>

Stories: I thought the story approach was a good option that hadn’t crossed my mind before. The author did this very nicely in the section bringing Uncle Pete into explaining how story telling can help emphasize one’s message. The uncle Pete story helped me think about people such as uncle Pete in my life, which made me realize that story telling is a great was to explain an idea or get the audience on the same page as you with a certain issue. 
            <br><br>

Metaphors: Everyone learns a little bit different. For example, I am a visual metaphor learner, if someone shows me a image or what is taking place, or explains and idea with a metaphor I am more likely to have an all-encompassing broad idea of what is going on. I think that this is really important for an issue such as climate action. If you examine it as harming the earth like smoking harms your lungs the metaphor learners might make the connection and be much more likely to take action. 
            <br><br>

Language: Language is SUCH an important aspect of human interaction. When I think about it, a certain word that someone chooses to use and make or break by mood of the conversation. Or when reading an article, I don’t have the patience to read something that uses dense language, Rather I would read something in simpler terms that gets the same point across. I think that this is really important to think about when discussion the climate crisis. I think we need to use language that everyone can understand. That is something that I really enjoyed in this piece. It choose to write the piece in term that accentuated the five points that it made. The language was not too complicate and stated the issue as facts that were in terms that were easy to understate. 
            <br><br>

Solutions: In my opinion you can throw a bunch of issues and problems at someone and then go expect them to feel empowered to make a change. You need to present them with solutions that can make the feel empowered and like they can make a change; by voting, reducing emissions, eating a plat-based diet, downsizing, and so much more. Make them feel hopeful, explain that there are solutions and the steps that we need to take to get there.

Each section was so thorough and easy to follow, it spoke to me a lot too! Preparation made me think back to when we read about “Why Scientists Disagree About Climate Change” and how persuasive it was for some readers. They clearly don’t have the facts straight, but they do have an audience and a way of making their false information sound true. Like you said, even if something is truly valid, it’s easy to dismiss if it doesn’t catch the audiences’ attention and has some convincing components. Climate change deniers who are good at this target those who already don’t know much about climate change, such as children, or to those who only look at the political sides of things. They’re already aware of how convinced their audience is gonna be. 
            <br><br>

I haven’t personally met any uncle petes, but I know that they exist and I see them on social media so much. Uncle Pete and the emphasis of storytelling reminded me of how we watch films that have more of an emotional impact than logical. Fire in Paradise, for example, is a great way of bringing forth true stories of how people's lives can be affected by climate change, and how it all connects back to the facts. These types of people are way too quick to deny the stats, so the method of storytelling makes a lot of sense. I connected metaphors with this fact as well. 
            <br><br>

Solutions definitely stuck out to me the most because it’s extremely uplifting seeing how we can improve. It definitely gets tiring hearing the downside of everything (even though it’s super important to know those things!), so having a plan, whether it be individual change or planning out your next vote for an election, is refreshing. I definitely became more interested in the class when we began to discuss solutions because I knew where everything was wrong. Some new facts were learned but I knew how terrible things were because I took an environmental studies class in high school. The difference is that my teacher didn’t really discuss any solutions. Seeing that I can make a change is a great thing.

Ken has a point when he says you have to watch what you say when you’re explaining things like being vegan to people. Many just want the gist of what the topic is. If you feel strongly about something, you usually like to talk about it and get very in depth but others wouldnt feel the same and are weirded out by your passion for the topic. 
            <br><br>
I also like how Ken added the parts about freeganism and being a climatarian. These are both great ways for people who want to be active in helping in being a part of changing the environment for the better but have a hard time trying to change their lifestyle habits. Going completely vegan is a huge step for someone who constantly eats meat and dairy products everyday but by being a climatarian, you can make better choices like instead of going for the cow milk, you instead grab a nut alternative. Instead of eating a hamburger, you go for a turkey burger.

Somerville’s suggestion for communicating with an “Uncle Pete” we may know highlights an approachable and respectful method to discussing the urgency of the situation and our own perspectives on the subject. However, I believe the personal change that Ken discusses must definitely occur first in order to influence other people for the better. With Somerville’s mention of metaphors, I believe they can be extremely impactful with the analogies used to deepen one’s understanding of the effect of greenhouse gas emissions as he discussed with the representation of carbon dioxide as the steroids of climate and how climate scientists are the planetary physicians, who are solely communicating the need for remedy of the planet that affects the entire human population, animal species, and ecosystems. Through the use of metaphors, we can include this in our discussion with skeptics and friends to better understand them to give them a broad understanding of the consequences of our lifestyle or at least the emissions being created from things that may go unnoticed in our daily lives.
            <br><br>

In addition, I believe what he said about being cautious and considering how we use language in our communication is extremely important to not shut down any ideas or considerations of climate change’s reality, such as by considering the audience we are talking to and avoiding jargon that may not be understood without explanation or expertise. Skills like public speaking or simple conversation assets are vital to having effective and informative discussions with peers if we really want to see changes taken in our lifetime, which is important to be aware of what the words we use mean as represented by his example of how “positive feedback (loop)” may be misunderstood.
            <br><br>

Overall, I believe the solutions he shared are the ultimate goal of what we must communicate to convey scientific evidence that has been proven by credible organizations and scientists in order to ensure comprehension. In regards to how I may personally go about conveying such information, I believe Ken’s suggestion is most applicable with the need to avoid being pushy and confrontational about it and let our actions speak for itself by walking the talk.

In regards to the reading by Summerville, I was pleasantly surprised to see the way that Summerville framed Uncle Pete and how we should communicate with him. Often times in debates, it devolves into an us vs. them argument about who is right and neither side is willing to relent. I see many people often resort to attacking the other side’s intelligence and beliefs. While the frustration is understandable, especially in regards to climate change denial, treating the other side in this manner is unlikely to sway many people to reconsider the facts as they know it and offer a chance for growth. With the reading, Summerville chose to consider Uncle Pete’s perspective in the way he sees it and calmly correct the misconceptions of this fictitious yet real character without resorting to ad hominem. I think this is personally the best way to get across to many people, albeit the sad part is that many people will remain firm in their denial of the science because of the efforts of oil company propaganda to spread misinformation. We can only do our best and continue to spread the facts as they are to the people that remain uninformed about the truth.

This week's reading “Communicating Climate Change Science” is my favorite so far. The book uses various stories, allegorical stories, scientific stories, and some metaphors to express environmental issues to the public. This is a very novel and attractive way. I really like it. My favorite analogy is the carbon dioxide analogy in the book. The book compares carbon dioxide to quasars. In this situation, plenty of CO2 on the earth may not make one particular day hotter, but the gross climate may increase.
            <br><br>
The meteorologists mentioned by Ken in the future may be very interesting. For forecast weather, I have always thought that it is similar to black magic. No matter how careful people observe the weather, we can't predict how God will change, which is why weather predictions are always inaccurate. There is too much in the universe that we don't know, and whether predicting astrology is a task that humans can achieve remains to be seen. If we can really predict the exact weather, it will be very helpful for environmental protection.

I thought to reply to you because this reading was not one of my favorites. But thats just because I've discussed this topic before in other classes and think it has been covered in other readings. However, this topic is one of the parts I'm most interested in when discussing climate change. So much so, I'm thinking about adding a double major or Communications to join my Environmental Science study. 
            <br><br>
Anyways, I agree that these metaphors, analogies, stories, and this imagery is extremely interesting. My favorite metaphor was comparing athletes using steroids to how CO2 affects the climate. Although they are fun, I think that rather remembering specific analysis, we should focus on the bigger picture. And that is, friendly messaging and approaches can make educating your family and friends about climate change much more digestible. If everyone in this class were to take these suggestions, to use facts, stories, and metaphors and listen to their audience, think about the total impact we could make. Especially after discussion how the media polarizes people on environmental issues every day, this seems like a very important lesson.

Like Steven this week readings has been one of my favorites so far. I feel like this chapter was very effective at showing ways to try to convince those uncle Pete people who don’t like to believe in climate science. Like Ken said in this video we need to set these people on the path to believing in climate change rather than force it down their throat.
            <br><br>


Somervills advice seemed very practical to me. The way he says we need to have 1 reliable person repeating the same message over and over. If you have multiple people throwing all these things out and who have no credibility then the message won’t get sent and it actually might get people to not want to associate themselves with that group. Furthermore, the steroid example is an easy way to try to convey to uncle Pete why we should care about climate change. Sometimes using metaphors can help people understand and remember the magnitude of the issue at hand. I also agree with his point that global warming was not the best term to use as it oversimplified the issue at hand and was only describing symptoms and not the problem. Overall, it was a great read and I look forward to using some of his advice.

This week’s reading is an important thing to go over because once we leave this class, we are better educated in the subject of climate change. But the world around us remains stagnant. They did not go through a quarter of readings, films, and lectures to learn. I know before this class, I believed in climate change, but I was not as moved as I am now to do something about it. I’m considering my eating habits, my future home, my necessary and unnecessary possessions, and the like. Regardless, before and during and after this course, I was, am, and will be a believer of climate change. There are those who are not. That’s why I appreciate our discussion of Uncle Pete. In the reading, he is used as an example. It was really important and useful for me to read about how to confront a skeptic like Uncle Pete who may deny climate change for whatever reason. For example, Uncle Pete may not believe climate change has to do with science. He may believe it is a natural increase that is not as harmful as the media may paint it out to be. To Uncle Pete, climate change is simply an opportunity for the government, and for liberals and environmentalists, to make rules and regulations, to interfere with markets, and to diminish the personal freedom of individuals. It’s a way for the state to have more control over the lives of citizens. This is a scary thing to assume is true, but thankfully it is not. 
            <br><br>

Further delving into the situation, the book points out how Uncle Pete, an example of people in real life, may seriously fear that the government will not only claim the right to decide what kind of car he will be allowed to drive, but will ultimately want to force him to limit his individual carbon footprint, that is, to ration his personal emissions of heat-trapping gases… his claims still messed up. If Uncle Pete wants to avoid the government controlling his life and diminishing his freedom, as all of us do, then we all need to learn about and accept science. In his case, it is not an argument on science to sway him, but a bit of logic. The government would not need to enforce these things if the world was not going deteriorating. We all need to take the threat of climate change seriously. We all must act wisely, and urgently, to minimize it. For me, the best reason for communicating climate change science widely and accurately is that doing so can inform people and increase the likelihood that the world will act promptly, wisely, and forcefully.

From the lecture and the videos, I learned that consuming meat is releasing great amount of greenhouse gases. I had read about the fifty list of things to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, including a lot of personal actions like avoiding consuming meat. A lot of statistics and research told us we have to start our actions now to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases which helps to prevent the global temperature from larger increase. I believe a lot of vegetarians now are following their religions or beliefs, but for a normal person to change oneself's habit from eating meat to eating vegans is not a easy thing. I believe most of us are not willing to do that. I do think it needs a long, continuing process for people to change their eating habits. It might connect with some of policies which decreases the number of animals such as cows, providing beef for human beings. Also, a lot of people are not aware of the serious problem of consuming meat such as my family. Last week I firstly told them this problem, they were surprised and wondered how producing beef is relating to climate crisis. I think people on the Earth should know about the information which consuming beef are negatively releasing great amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and let them to focus on their actions and thoughts to change their diet. I feel sad I am aware that rare my friends are vegetarians. I believe if we behave more united and set a approachable goal each year on reducing the emission of greenhouse gases in order to make a change, the future will be much more hopeful.

This week’s reading is particularly interesting in a way that it talks about appealing to people around us and communicating the messages that we have learned in class. I found some of Ken’s points are new to me such as how paradoxical it may sound to not educate people on the climate crisis and talk about personal actions instead. A long time ago since I was in middle school, I participated in a summer camp and got home-steaded by a Christian host family. I remembered how I was astonished to know that three young kids in the family were vegetarian just like their parents. They were mostly 10 years old and had kept a vegetarian diet for a few years. At first, I thought me as a meat-lover might be unwelcome to the family but to my surprise, they were friendly and very welcoming for me and for my diet choice. Though they kept influence me through multiple ways and I found myself very comfortable in receiving their messages. They didn’t spend a lot of time convincing me on how good a vegan diet is, they instead shared with me their personal experience as vegetarians and showed me that they remain absolutely healthy.

            <br><br>

I guess this experience could be really insightful for me to educate my family and friends about the climate crisis. As I became alerted after taking Climate Crisis 101, I would love to share the facts and understandings that I learned in this class with someone whom I hope would be accepting them. But I must do it wisely and effectively following the materials covered by Ken in this lecture and the readings.

When reading this weeks reading, it was extremely helpful and not so dense. A major thing that I believe I lacked in this class was how to talk to other about the climate crisis, and this reading really helped with that. I have gained all this knowledge of how to go about things, or the rights and wrongs about going about the climate change, the facts, but talking to others about this was something that I found difficult. Understanding that just speaking the facts and using metaphors to explain the crisis to others is pretty well information. A major thing that has been implied within the book, was that all these facts and knowledge have been proven to be true time after time again, by many different scientists and those who study the climates. A major topic that needs to be talked about is that many people need to understand that these issues are not about what if, or if it is true. These issues are true, and now it just about how to go about these issues to help fix it for the benefit of the newer generation and the world.

This week's readi ang about communication was very interesting, the fact that it was divided into 4 sections was even more helpful. Like the part preparation: it is hard to found out that what people might say in their daily life. Therefore, they have to target their samples, and then try to let them understand. In Ken’s video, the word “vegetarian” might bring some negative impression to others, and due to the stereotype about this word, telling others to be a vegan to protect the Earth is like to force others to eat vegetables and profit to consume meat. However, calling others a climatarian is more easy for others to do something to Earth, and it’s more like a sacred title for them, which will make them more likely to protect Earth and to be motivated.

I experienced the same thing when I went vegan. First from my mom, who truly did not understand. And then by every other person when they found out. Most of them were surprised, probably because I'm not running around screaming my head off about my anti-meat opinions. It scares people. Most of my friends now (who could NEVER see themselves as vegan) are respectful about my choices, and may even accommodate if they know that ill probably snag some of their food. I think its all about how opinions come off, and attacking will cause anyone to draw away when the goal should be to pass along a message that people will be able to understand and appreciate.  
            <br><br>


Using an “Uncle Pete” is a very effective way of categorizing everyone who from stubborness or self interest refuses to understand the facts. The truth is, there are probably many people who do not believe in climate change because they are not given the correct information in an understandable way, or have only seen it as a liberal agenda. I doubt that there is an overwhelming majority who truly are opposed to the science, and many of them are probably the ones who are making money off of fossil fuel companies. Given this information, its a matter or rebranding, or just reframing climate change.

            <br><br>

I really liked the chart that was given on better ways to communicate terms. Its tempting to try to sound smart, but at the end of the day, if 97% of scientists agree about climate change, then you aren't really trying to convince them, You're trying to convince the millions of people that dont. Who maybe are coming from a less educated background, or will get frustrated with the smug language that flows throughout many articles. It makes sense that some people will pick up on the frustration flowing throughout the text, but what the goal should be is delivering a clean, concise, and understandable analysis of events. It should make sense, plain as day. I shouldn't have to dig through the dirt to find a meaning. 

            <br><br>

I also agree with the Solution section. People respond much better to hope and positive things. Give them something to look forward to, a goal that is reachable. Saying all the bad things and never throwing a rope to pull them out of the dark tunnel gives no one incentive to improve. Sommerville did an amazing job outlining the faulty nature of how the climate crisis is presented, and what can be done to fix them.

I had somewhat of an opposite experience than you did in regards to veganism. I have been vegetarian for about 3 years now, and now consider myself flegan (a flexible vegan). However I didn't always understand veganism. My dad has been vegan for years and use to talk about it nonstop. This turned me away from veganism and made me almost resent it until I became passionate about the subject. I really appreciate the reading and Ken's video this week because it makes me wonder if my dad waited to inform me on the issue for when I was curious if I would have been so opposed. Additionally, this reading and video makes me reflect on my own actions and how I speak about the climate crisis and my eating habits. I will try to be more conscientious about my audience and what they care about.

From this week's reading I got that we must learn more about the science behind climate change and spread our knowledge to those who do not know the harmful effects we are causing. For example, our elders. Therefore, we must be able to fully understand all science, support our claims with scientific evidence, and fully exchange our views in order to provide more effectiveness. In other words, we need to arm ourselves with knowledge to become smarter. For example, for climate change, a very common refutation that deniers like to put forward is that the change of climate model is due to the natural rotation of the earth. It's obviously problematic to imagine that it would be more terrible if the earth didn't turn, but v、Veerbhadran Ramanathan, Roger Aines and Max Auffhammer discussed that "the impact of orbital changes is too small to produce the large warming observed in recent decades." The author uses their own scientific discovery, effective communication ability, the influence of their titles in the industry, and the automatic credibility of scientists to fully prove the existence of climate change and how climate change is mainly caused by human beings.

I was very appreciative of the fact that the reading focused so heavily on understanding Uncle Pete's point of view. Often times I am so quick to write off people who are in disbelief over climate change because I figure they have their investments in things such as mining and fossil fuel industries, which is why they won't even switch over to support the climate crisis. However, this reading brought a new focus to light, which emphasized that something like climate change might make people feel as though the government has more reason to take advantage of Americans. I personally haven't really come across somebody who is exactly an Uncle Pete, however, I know for a fact that this problem of the climate crisis hasn't even begun to become a conversation in places like India, and I am very curious to see what my relatives would say if I brought it up. I feel as though my cousins would be much more quick to understand than my aunts and uncles particularly, especially since the impoverished portion of India that I reside in whenever I visit is always flooded with the upper class taking advantage of poor people. They consider buying new clothes a common and effective practice in order to display their wealth, something that I personally will never understand. Learning these communication tools such as neutralizing scientific jargon and even emphasizing that the odds for extreme weather are much higher make it easier to convey a sense of urgency without discounting whatever they believe to be true. In addition, I appreciated that there was a direct connection between medicine and  climate change, however I thought it was almost disproportional because I think that people find it easier to wrap their heads around something that is directly affecting them versus something that could have tons of different factors. I think the devastation factor regarding climate change might be something we're experiencing now, but I doubt that with the time we have left and the growing number of skeptics, we'll be able to make much change.

Actually when I know about one of my friends is a "vegetarian" , I will have the same response like Ken's friends although it was me to ask for his or her food preferences. And this noun does has a stereotype in the bottom of my heart and I consider this label as impractical. But after hearing about that Ken just acted like what he said in every aspect of his life like keeping a small wardrobe, using  electricity-generating vehicles, etc. I think I can gradually accept this opinion. Like considering Climate Arianism as a transition of pescatarians to vegans, Ken mentioned methods that vegans can use to communicate their food choice to people around them. After all, if they want to let their friends and surrounding people accept and even adopt this opinion, the best way to realize it is that acting as what they said.

I enjoyed this week's reading because it was an answer to a question I have been asking for a couple of weeks now. I had been wondering how we can approach the ‘Uncle Pete’ people in our lives and bring up the climate change issue. Of course, I have several Uncle Petes’ in the form of my aunts and uncles. When I try to bring up the climate change issue to them they refuse to listen and just say that my University is turning me ‘too liberal’. This is an issue the book also brought up because some people are refusing to acknowledge climate change as a scientific issue; instead of regarding it as a political issue where liberals are disguising as environmentalists to pass policies. 
            <br><br>

The reading was much easier to understand compared to other readings and I feel like even my younger brother would be able to understand this chapter. I agree with the author saying that a lot of climate scientists do not know how to effectively get their point across to a non-academic audience. Sometimes I would try watching videos or reading articles of scientists trying to explain their research results and would lose interest because of the scientific jargon utilized. When too many numbers, words or statistics I did not understand would be used as their evidence I would be too lost to comprehend. Another important factor in teaching others was knowing the science behind climate change to give themselves more credibility and the ability to refute any myths they bring up. Prof. Hiltner mentioned that people should not be forced to learn this. I think that is very important because if people do not want to learn they will not listen at all. Instead, we should focus our energy teaching others who do want to learn more about the climate change crisis.

As a communications major, I feel this challenge to effectively communicate the reality and solutions to the climate crisis is something my field can come together to successfully do to take action. Allotting money and energy into mass communication on this topic are very worthwhile. 
            <br><br>


Vegans can be awkward to eat with, especially being someone who loves meat-lover pizzas and all you can eat Brazilian barbeques. In all honesty, the past couple years, my meat intake has to be in the top 1% of Americans, the country with the highest meat consumption. While politely, actively, and attentively listening to Ken's argument on climatarians, but I'd rather stop flying all together. Freeganism seems feasible. However, because I eat 4 meals a day at a buffet style cafeteria, this wont help me be the change I want to see in the world either. Unfortunately, my society has made me addicted to growing muscle mass and eating much more protein than carbs. While my ketosis diet is healthy for me, I now realize its very unhealthy for the environment and selfish. I need to rethink whether looking good is more important to me than holding myself accountable to hurting the environment.

I thought the chapter on communicating climate change was informative. My favorite part was where they talked about what language you should use when talking to people about climate change. You should use the proper language for your audience. Using complicated and scientific words would confuse most people and it can cause things to be misinterpreted. We should use simple and passionate language to get our points across easier. 
            <br><br>

I also agree that we should face our problems with hope. Being sad or hopeless about things won't do any good. We still have time to fix this mess and we have lots of support. Many countries have already decided to take action and we must soon decide if we will join them. "I think the main barriers to action today are not technical or financial. They are a lack of widespread political will and a lack of wise and inspiring political leadership." (8-36) The United States has the money and technology to fight climate change but that means nothing if our government doesn't care. We must change that by becoming politically active and vote for those who will make climate change a priority. We must motivate people and tell them that there's still time to change things.
            <br><br>

I also agree that for lots of people, climate change is not a science issue, but a political issue. People are deeply entrenched in their beliefs and it's hard to change their perspectives. However, it is true that if we do nothing now then climate change will only get worse and global tensions will increase as more people are displaced from their homes and fight for resources. The world will be thrown into a state of chaos. We must get these people to think about the consequences of doing nothing and motivate them to act.

I also agree that we should face our problems with hope. There is no help that we are being sad or hopeless about things. Just like you mentioned that we still have time to fix this mess and we have lots of support. This week's reading is about communication and how to deal with the climate crisis. The problem is that there are still many people who do not believe that our planet is gradually destroying now. The main reason why many people think this is a climate problem is a lie is that they think it is a strategy to get the government more involved in people's lives and have more regulation. If nothing is done, however, governments will eventually have to regulate when things get messy. They offer some interesting ideas, such as how people are reluctant to trust scientists. Although people know that scientists are not reliable sometimes, they still believe in medical scientists. Even though climate scientists are specializing in the area of climate, they still think they are not reliable. Thus, I think you are right. Climate crisis is not only a science issue, but it also is a political issue. The government needs to take action and warn people.

In the Reading “Communicating Climate Change Science” chapter 8 from the book Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions was an interesting read. In the reading talks about ways how to talk about something when and making sure that what you communicate is very effective. I know that people get lost when really talking about the details when talking about important topics like climate change. I know that because sometimes very important topics come out and I zone out because I cannot follow along with the language these people are using. Finding a middle ground when talking about climate change or other pressing topics is needed and I believe would be very helpful. Instead of having all these big words or intense detail. I have been lucky in terms of the people around me who believe in the climate crisis. This whole uncle Pete is interesting. I use the knowledge I have to tell my friends and my family because I believe that it is important when they ask of course. It still amazes me that people really think that climate change is not real and how they shut down any talk about climate change. It's really sad that people use science in order that says that climate change is not real. I like the idea of climatarinism is a very interesting thing. Being a climatarian would make people aware of what they are eating and how it impacts the climate and the world. This could be very impactful towards the climate crisis.

I share very similar viewpoints as you! There are definitely times when I fail to educate myself on important subjects because all of the diction and statistics being used are too unfamiliar for me to follow along. This class was one of the first times issues like the climate crisis have been in terms simple enough for me to understand. While younger generations already make up the main generations fighting for better environmental policies, I bet we’d have even more of a following if more people our age were able to understand the facts of the situation. Ken has done a really good job this year in being able to present the facts without sugar-coating them but still keeping them simple enough to understand. 
            <br><br>

In terms of the “Uncle Pete” that’s talked about in the readings, I’ve definitely had to interact with my fair share of Uncle Pete’s. Some of my family, as much as I love them, does not “agree” with climate change. This confuses me, because I don’t know how you can just disagree with the indisputable fact that the Earth’s temperature is rising. Most of these family members really just don’t want to give up some of their personal freedoms for the sake of the planet (you guessed it, they’re boomers). I’m hoping to employ some of the author’s strategies for dealing with an Uncle Pete with them. I really want to have useful discussions with them rather than pointless arguments, because we want everyone fighting the same fight if we’re going to save the planet.

This week’s reading “Bending the curve: climate change solutions”, I gained more knowledge on how to be a successful communicator of climate change science through five steps. After reading the article, I realized that the way to spread the knowledge of how to tackle climate change is crucial to solving the problem. Even if there are multiple things for people to do in their daily life in order to help solving the climate crisis, they will be pointless unless you convince people to take actions. So, being able to commute the idea of climate crisis and how to solve it is our very first step on tackling the whole problem. I find a few things in chapter 8 really relatable. As mentioned in the reading, language is very important, and communicators should avoid depressing language and jargons. When people talk to me about climate crisis, lots of them have a condescending tone and it makes me really uncomfortable. It is as if they feel morally superior to me by teaching me how to live my life. I think that’s why a lot of people have a negative attitude toward acknowledging the climate crisis. They don’t resent the fact that climate crisis is real but resent there are people trying to tell them this as if they don’t know about it. Another thing is that it is important to give people solutions after telling them all the natural disasters happening in the world because no one wants to feel helpless. I hate looking at videos of polar bears swimming in the ocean because the ice is melting. I just want to know what I can do and how it can help with the ice melting.

I completely agree with you.  Like said in Chapter 8 of “Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions”, you can have all the knowledge in the world on a certain topic, but if you cannot communicate it well to the public, nothing will change.  For me, this chapter really hit home considering I am pursuing a degree in biological oceanography.  I want to be able to learn about the effects that certain changes in the climate have on species and their place in the ecosystem they belong to.  But, in order to do that, it is extremely important that I would know how to convey my findings in a way that it can actually help reverse negative effects I track in research I do.  Like the example of “Uncle Pete”, I liked how the reading really outlined examples on how to deal with certain situations, such as using facts and and civility to pass on information in a clear and concise manner.  By understanding social science and genuinely just understanding the other person and their point of view, you can approach them effectively, scientifically and politically.  Metaphors were also interesting for me, considering how easy a comparable image comes with the facts.  This can open the minds of many different types of people, many of which would not otherwise want to listen.

Reading this week is different from other readings I read. Talking about communication skills in the science of climate change. This surprised me and suddenly realized that it was not enough to just discuss the impact of climate change or what we can do to combat it. All these discussions are useless without effective and convenient communication, because it is important for the audience to understand this so that they can realize the severity of climate change and the importance of taking immediate action. I totally agree with two points in Ken's speech. First, Ken's points out that listening to others is a successful way to motivate people to take action. He talked about the best time and the best way to talk, and I also found it useful to exchange new ideas by using examples of eating with friends and trying to convey ideas to friends. He also claims that this climate strategy will not only play a personal role, but also encourage others to take action. Then, I completely agree with him that you need to change yourself before you change the world, otherwise you may cause more trouble. In reading, pointing out more specific communication details gave me a clearer idea of ​​how to convey scientific information in a more accessible and effective way. This chapter shows five steps that are being prepared, story, metaphor, language and solution. Both are reasonably useful and logical. As with the first step, the preparation is good, and the readings first point out the fact that people, especially climate scientists, often use "complex topics" to communicate and ignore "simple and clear information", which will make people It's hard to figure out the point.

After reading the chapter 8, Communicating Climate Change Science, I feel my horizon was broadened again significantly. I love the structure of this chapter, which divides into five major parts: Preparation, Stories, Metaphors, Language and Solutions. I was impressed by one particular sentence: “I suggest, that, at a minimum, we owe our descendants a planet that is as undamaged as the one we inherited from previous generations.” Admittedly, it’s such a shame to leave a damaged planet to our descendants because it is unfair at all. Our descendants deserve a beautiful planet just like us. And I personally do not intend to be blamed by my grandchildren because of my ignorance about the climate change. There is also a very conspicuous picture which illustrates the summary of the key results of the Working Group I. It’s such a great way to show all of the striking facts in just twelve short sentences because it’s much easier to read and understand. In the end of this chapter, it is glad to see that we have at least made some progress already in some countries even though we still have a long way to go. It is a not-bad beginning. In conclusion, the main purpose of this reading is to motivate people to make actions to change. From my opinion, it does achieve its goal.

This week’s reading of “Communication Climate Change Science” has brought up some very useful tactics when trying to communicate the climate crisis to people who may be skeptical of the topic. Because I actually know some people who do not believe in the existence of climate change, I am curious to see if implementing these communicative methods will help in convincing them otherwise. After this reading, I was impressed with the different approaches that were mentioned. I found it interesting that small methods such as language and metaphors could make a significant difference in the way we communicate and present the evidence of the climate crisis. I also appreciated that the methods presented were very realistic and applicable to actual conversations that go on in everyday life. Rather than making it a radical way of communicating, the reading emphasized the smaller and more effective methods that we can use, especially if the other party is stubborn or in denial. This is important because I feel as though if you are also being stubborn and persistent about it, it will only escalate and give the other person a more negative view of climate change and those who support it. 
            <br><br>


Another point that I thought was really interesting was professor Ken’s argument that we should not be the ones to initiate the conversation, but rather live by example and let others inquire about the choices you make for the environment. The idea of using “climatarian” and “freegan” kind of reminded me about the readings with how the use of language is important when communicating your views on the climate crisis. Personally, this approach seems more effective to me because I have seen how the label of being “vegan” can carry a negative connotation sometimes. But also because I feel like waiting for the opportunity to talk about how we can personally mitigate the climate crisis when others are ready for the conversation will be seen as less aggressive than if we were to initiate the same conversation. This really comes down to the idea that people do not like to be told what to do or what choices to make. Intuitively, this makes sense. If we promote climatarianism, we still give people a choice, increasing the willingness for people to change. After all, these little changes in people’s mindsets can actually be a crucial process in mitigating the climate crisis. Not everyone will suddenly and radically change their lifestyles–but if we can start having these types of conversations, then we can at least take small and progressive steps towards making better choices. Reflecting back on my own personal experience, I noticed that I actually don’t know what my family’s opinion on climate change is. Although I know that they are more on the conservative side, climate change has never been a point of discussion that we’ve had before. After this reading, I feel as though I am better equipped and ready if my family and I were to have that conversation.

Mm. I'm not so sure I agree; in my experience with "Uncle Pete", people don't even initiate the discussion with you - or, if they start losing the conversation, say "look I just have more life experience then you and this conversation is getting uncomfortable can we please change the subject". In a very real sense, many of these people will not engage unless you make them engage with the subject; you need to point these things out or start the conversation yourself sometimes or you're just never going to talk about a difficult subject more than once.

Communication around climate change has always been a special interest of mine, and I think it is clear that it’s something scientists have historically struggled with. It’s no fault of their own, as they often have to work against the interests and deep pockets of oil and natural gas firms. Communicating the nature and urgency of climate change without conveying a sense of confusion or despair is a difficult task, and throughout this course we have read many articles and watched many films that have approached this issue from a variety of perspectives and strategies. David Wallace-Wells chose to take a darker point of view, outlining what could be our worst possible climate future. While movies like Being the Change focused more on the positive and achievable aspects of living a climate conscious lifestyle. Both of these contrasting strategies have their own strengths and weaknesses and it can be challenging for myself to determine some sort of middle ground in my own discussions about climate change. That is why I was very grateful for this week's reading, because it provided many helpful tips and strategies for those discussions.
            <br><br>
The suggestions made in this reading include; posing CC as a moral and ethical issue, knowing my own weaknesses and gaps in understanding, and the use of metaphors and stories as valuable ways to convey information. I will definitely implore these and other techniques I learned from the reading in my future discourses on CC. I intend on taking up a professional writing minor in my coming years at UCSB and I think this information will be especially helpful for my future career, whatever it may be.
            <br><br>
Additionally, Ken's recommendations in the accompanying YouTube video were equally helpful. In the past, I’ve definitely been the person to bring up climate issues, and this can definitely cause some people to disengage. Instead, and in the future, I will let people come to me with their own curiosity and inquiries, and I will try to answer them or guide them to the best of my abilities.

<p>
To start off, I'd like to mention how appreciative I am that Ken explained the two alternatives to help aid conversations that go sour after lifestyles/diet labels are brought up. Not only do they help conversations that have turned sour, but they also help prevent any awkwardness that can potentially arise from the topic. I personally have never been much of a meat eater, but I consume lots of other foods that vegetarians and vegans would typically refrain from. When someone fills me in on the information that they are a vegetarian or vegan, I feel hesitant to say I don't share those same habits. I feel as though I would be looked down upon by those who choose to be vegetarian or vegan for the sake of the planet. Not only does this experience simply make me uneasy, it gives me the impression that I have an insane amount of change to endure and undergo in order to begin the battle against climate change within my own life. I actually have not met anyone that has used the term "freegan" or "climatarian", but I appreciate those terms. They feel more welcoming and achievable or realistic. It is simply doing what you can while it being better for the environment as well as for yourself as an individual.

I really enjoyed this week’s reading, as it was simple, easy to understand, and got the message through quite easily. It compared climate change to a range of common problems, to reduce its complexity to the audience. One thing I really enjoyed was the part about Uncle Pete and how scientific evidence was able to disprove everything that “hypothetical” uncle was saying. I think that part was really important because in our lives, we all have encountered a person who refuses to believe climate change is real. While we can’t change their refusal to believe their facts, we can disprove the points they make with facts, and examples from this textbook. Hopefully, one of those will stick into their heads and they will agree to actually listen to the facts, instead of just rejecting everything immediately after hearing it. We need to have more conversations with climate change deniers, to inform more people of what is happening before it is too late.
             <br><br>
Many years ago, I had a friend from Texas who adamantly refused to believe that climate change is real. Back then, I didn’t even try to convince her with facts, as I didn’t want to start a fight, and also because I didn’t have enough facts at that time. However, with the information I have received from this class I am confident that I could respectfully break down her argument and maybe have a chance in convincing her about this harsh reality. That’s what i love about this class, that I can apply the knowledge I’ve gained to outside situations and that this knowledge will help me in the real world.

I agree wholly with this quote from the chapter “Communicating Climate Change Science” from Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions. Climate change may have a science backing it that is needed to prove its theories analytically, but the causes of climate change are based in our cultures, societies, and beliefs. It’s based in the way we run our governments, our economies, our education systems, you name it. At the root of all of this is our hearts and our heads. Our moral, spiritual, and ethical beliefs play into the behaviors and social structures that have led us down this path.
             <br><br>

“What do we owe…” I think that this is an interesting way of phrasing the moral issues of climate change because “owing” implies we have the obligation to pay or render something. I think that we should approach environmentalism not as what we should be doing, but as what we can do. Giving back to the Earth shouldn’t be a chore or a series of transactions. It’s a constant circle. Our world is run and balanced by cyclical processes. We have often tried to view human progress in a linear manner, but we forget that all of life and all matter in general on the Earth’s surface is constantly being reused. Everything goes somewhere. 
             <br><br>

Another thing that stood out to me from this reading is to remember to be warm, positive, and a good listener when trying to communicate climate change issues. This is important because it is easy to get frustrated and depressed when dealing with the climate crisis. Those negative emotions can translate into pointed anger towards naivety and inaction because it’s easy to place blame on one another when it is our society as a whole that has caused these problems. When trying to communicate the climate crisis, we have to accept each others flaws and move forward together. It’s important to remember to be sure you are not on the offensive so your audience does not feel the need to defend themselves. When discussing man-made climate change, being sure to speak from the perspective of the collective “we” and add in possible remediations everyone can make.
             <br><br>

One question I have is in regards to the idea that using short clear messages repeated by a plethora of trusted messengers. I was wondering how fictional characters might play into this idea? Would Scooby Doo solving the mystery of the ozone hole have a similar/stronger/weaker message than Leonardo DiCaprio doing it? How has fiction and imagination played into our moral and cultural values, and could an ecocentric shift in the media and fiction bring about similar change?

I really enjoyed reading “Communicating Climate Change Science”. This passage breaks down the ways in which people should communicate to others, especially climate change deniers, the issue of climate change, due to its severity and need for immediate action. The way Somerville wrote this chapter, itself, shows how climate change should be addressed; the passage is concise, easy to read, and filled with metaphors which exemplifies both the facts behind climate change and the right forms of communication in regards to it. The points that he discusses help the reader understand climate change in simplistic terms so that they can also explain it to others in a similar manner.
             <br><br>
The lecture video is a good supplementary element to the reading because Ken offers ways to communicate to people who already believe in climate change, yet have not made active changes to help mitigate the issue. I like how he mentions to be subtle in explaining actions such as an environmentally beneficial diet. It is better for someone to be curious and ask, rather than for an activist to inundate people with information that they are reluctant to hear about.

I agree with you. After reading the selected part of “Communicating Climate Change Science”, I realized that communication is significant, not only in climate activism, but in all aspects of our lives. We need to learn to communicate our concerns about the climate crisis to others, and this reading chapter provides actual methods that we can use to persuasive others that the climate change is real and is happening. The doubt in climate change is the biggest obstacle nowadays to take concrete actions. The author calls the people who still believe the climate crisis is a hoax “Uncle Pete”. Those Uncle Pete especially the elders among are very stubborn and often refuse to listen, which leads to a great difficulty to convince. I also like the way you mentioned that if we are unable to persuasive the activists with the information they are reluctant to hear about, we could rather choose to leave them curious and let them question the situation. Having a strategic communication skill is a half win of the battle. We need to learn and apply them correctly.

I enjoyed this reading, as the author did a great job at outlining useful techniques to communicate about the complexities and facts surrounding climate change, humans’ effects on the crisis, and the repercussions of such actions. These can all be extremely sensitive topics, especially when delving into them with someone who is not fully convinced of the crisis to begin with. I appreciated the authors’ direct methods that they mention as framework for starting these sorts of conversations. I especially enjoyed the section about ‘narratives’ and using stories as a means of conveying environmental information and its criticalness to be acted on in a timely manner. I think these sorts of narratives are especially helpful to people who do not fully understand the scope and level of academic brevity that is associated with scientific studies. Although it is unfortunate, from my own experience with my own Uncle Pete, some people truly do not care about scientific studies. And even if these studies strike a chord within them, they do not fully understand how these studies and modern tools are conducted. Within that fact, they cannot fully understand  their validity or what it means to be peer reviewed. Having a methodology that utilizes simple, more visual tactics helps supplement this information. It allows listeners to more fully understand the whole picture and to be able to review, remember, and hopefully even relate this information to others in their life.

             <br><br>

I also appreciated Ken’s snippet in this video that mentions that as competent climate communicators, one key aspect of this process is not actually initiating the conversation first. I think this is crucial in order for people to ever actually listen to what you have to say. Patience and carefully crafted information curation are so vital to framing this conversation and topic in a truthful light. I wish we had this lecture/reading sooner just because I found it so useful.

Although this read was great, I probably wouldn’t have read it if I wasn’t in this class. I love that Ken has broadened our knowledge by giving us so many different educational works. This one in particular was really interesting to me because I am big on communication and ensuring that I am using my words in the best way. I always want to make sure I’m prepared for whatever I need to say, and this reading helped me with that. I also agree with many others that the Uncle Pete metaphor made absorbing what was being said just that much easier. The author discusses different arguments against anthropogenic climate change that Uncle Pete would make, and a lot of them hit home. I went and visited my grandparents last summer and my grandpa was not too happy that I am an Environmental Studies major. He would say that the temperature was the same as it was 100 years ago. Which is not true, but you couldn’t change his mind no matter what statistics or articles you showed him. It’s just like the reading mentions, “There are people, like Uncle Pete, who are unwilling to believe things that they wish were not true, or who just don’t trust experts.” This mindset of people like Uncle Pete make it so hard to communicate climate change science. Especially because it can feel like you’re talking to a brick wall, which can make your tone off putting to anyone you’re talking to. 
              <br><br>

We must pick our battles in a sense when we communicate to others about this. Sometimes when we bring up the conversation people can get turned off by it and simply won’t listen to anything you have to say. So sometimes it can be a better option to wait for people to bring it up themselves and then talk about it. I have found this strategy to be helpful, especially when talking to family members. It also allows me to not come off as an “annoying activist” when speaking to my conservation family, which allows them to listen to what I have to say for at least a moment before tuning me out. Having communication and effective conversation even for a small amount of time is better than an hour long conversation that is a dead end. Pick your battles when talking to Uncle Pete types and don’t be discouraged if it doesn’t always go the way you like or want.

I think the advice given in this week’s reading was good. It gave some basic psychological principles for debate such as keeping your response simple and repeating your main points often. I grew up around many Uncle Petes. Everything I originally heard about climate change came from Uncle Petes so this class has greatly changed my viewpoint on the subject. I have also heard many of the myths surrounding climate change, so it was interesting seeing them refuted in this way. The problem I see is more fundamental though. The subject of climate change has become divided among party lines even though it should be a bipartisan issue. I can somewhat sympathize with Uncle Pete because electing someone purely because of their climate policy can bring about unwanted change in other areas of government. As seen in previous lectures, the climate crisis is relatively low on the political relevance scale and unfortunately, not every candidate plans to limit carbon emissions.

I could forget every single piece of information in the reading, but I'd still remember Figure 8.4.2, the chart showing terms that have different meanings for scientists and the general public. I read this reading last quarter, and the chart was the one thing that I knew was coming up when I was doing my reread. I was looking forward to that section, in fact. I'm still amused by how a single word can cause so much confusion. Phrasing something differently could completely change how your audience understands it. I study linguistics and communication, so stuff like this interests me. Some people fight about the usage of "literally," (there are whole opinion articles on its use and "misuse") but I don't see articles clearing up confusion on "words that are not scientific jargon, but... are used differently by scientists and the public." I see many sites explaining scientific jargon, but I don't see ones that go deeper and focus on the small misunderstandings. This section and chart is absolutely refreshing, and the information should be more widespread and available. 
              <br><br>

I've had a standard education, but I still wouldn't know all the scientific meanings of the words. I only know some from math and science classes, and it is not the case that everyone who has taken math or science classes will remember the definition of a few specific terms. Some of the words seem absurd to me, such as "uncertainty" meaning "ignorance," but others seem more reasonable, and I can see why there would be confusion. Math classes have taught me that a positive trend is an upward trend, but I bet that if I didn't have those math classes, I would have definitely thought positive meant good. 
              <br><br>


It'd be great if glossaries with information similar to that of this chart could be included in formal publications. Yet, it'd be difficult because scientists wouldn't be able to know which words would be misunderstood, similar to how teachers have difficulty knowing what students don't understand because they themselves already see it as obvious.

I found this reading very useful.  I think one of the most important things we need to do to fight climate change is to spread the word, and to “deny deniers” if you will.  The reality of the matter is, if we want a real change, we need a lot more people working towards our goal.  I have met my fair share of uncle petes in my life, not only uncle petes but also the kind of people who accept the fact that climate change is real but don’t seem to care about fixing it.  I think that these tips from the reading Ken gave us, can really be used towards both kinds of people.  I know that usually when I encounter a denier, I myself, can get very closed off to them as well.  I remember one encounter that I had, where I just essentially laughed and told the person they were wrong.  I feel like it’s so easy to do because often they are the kind of people who aren’t open to having their minds changed.  They aren’t open to other possibilities.  But for this very reason, we can’t write them off.  We can’t just accept that they are stubborn and there’s nothing that we can do.  
              <br><br>


I found this to be a very interesting reading because it showed a lot of techniques that I haven’t heard of yet, and am excited to try out next time I need to.  While I myself am not the most scientifically knowledgeable person, I did realize while reading this, that there is some specific jargon that I do use when discussing climate change.  I need to change that.  The positive feedback loop was a solid example that I could relate to.  Something else though that I definitely want to try, and I think could be very useful is the metaphors.  I think that it makes a lot of sense for people who aren’t educated, it makes it relatable to them.  It reminded me of the line from the movie, I believe it was in the True Cost(?I could be wrong on that one) where he says, if 97 doctors told you to use one course of treatment, and 3 disagreed, who would you listen to?  I think that it is things like this, that make it easily graspable for the general public.

From my personal experience, I have met a hardcore climate change denier on the train from Santa Barbara to LA. It was during my first year and I barely know anything about the actual damages climate changes has done, nor did I know all the facts and numbers about things such as the beef industry and airplane’s contribution to this crisis. This “Uncle Pete” which I encountered was sitting next to me writing up a document regarding a report for his job, and then he started a conversation with me about how I view climate change and whether or not I believed in it. Of course, as most sane people, I said climate change is happening and I do believe it has detrimental effects, but then this Uncle Pete begun “correcting” the information that I learned before. As he said, he works as the lead engineer for a project from a petroleum company, he knows a lot of data that can prove that climate change is not happening, and I was just sitting there listening to him showing me all these graphs and research. At the time, I really had no idea how to debate with him, and he was so convincing that I almost wanted to believe him. After we part ways, I felt like I lost a debate that I no knowledge about, and I was almost convinced by him. It is certainly important that individuals know more about the truth of climate change, or else they could be easily convinced such as myself.

I thought this was a great article, and I might even say it is one of the most vital readings for us in this class. Many of the other articles focused on facts or specific instances of the climate crisis, but this article was so helpful and productive in what I think is the most important take-away from this class: activism. I loved how the chapter broke up the topic into sections and delved into the details of each step of taking action. Starting out with a list of simple, cold, hard facts about the climate crisis is so important because with the climate denying the political climate we live in, it is so vital to have facts to present. Without facts, our stance and words will not be respected. I also really appreciated how it went into the way in which we can communicate and use language to create change. The facts we know will mean nothing without effective means of communication. I also think this is such an overlooked aspect that it was really cool that the chapter focused so much on it. 
              <br><br>
Beyond the article itself, I really enjoyed Ken’s video on the topic this week. This concept of freegans and climatarians is totally new to me and something that really caught my attention. It's so true about the stigma that the term vegan carries with it. I was vegan for a month this year and even in that short period of time I got so much negative pushback. I think when people think about eating with the environment in mind, they immediately think of vegan and the connotations that go along with this term. The concepts of freegan and climatarian are those that I feel could really be revolutionary to the way society deals with food. They both lack the strict rigidness of vegan which I think on its own would make them more appealing to the average American. I especially think that many people could easily switch to the climatarian lifestyle with ease. I also feel as though implementing the underlying action of freeganism into our lives could really make a difference bit by bit. These topics make me hopeful for the future of climate conscious eating.

Thanks for your comment; it encapsulates a lot of how I feel about this text. I think that that chapter really summarizes everything we've learned about how different people react to the climate crisis. 
              <br><br>
In particular, his analysis of why 'Uncle Pete' was fundamentally against believing in climate change really dived into reasons that I feel like Ken had to avoid mentioning explicitly due to teaching policies. A lot of people against preventing climate change are from a conservative background and see these solutions as a threat to personal freedom and as an expansion of government. As someone who also values personal freedom, I understand the hesitation of giving government more power. But my hesitation gets wiped away when the magnitude of the issue becomes apparent. I also like how the author provides a counter to a popular argument, that I myself once held, regarding the economic impact of leaving fossil fuels. He argues that renewables are already viable and that the free market is already began to expand their use. Once these fundamentals are covered, I think any argument that climate change is a hoax is just the inherent need to be correct.
              <br><br>
Finally I just wanted to add that his tone is crucial in delivering the stark message that the science is correct and that the danger is real. He frankly mentions is simple terms that he himself doesn't like the term global warming because of how it insinuates that the only threat is warming. I think the key to convincing people about the dangers we face is literature of this nature.

I agree-- the chapter provided a very concise summary of the data pertaining to the climate crisis that would definitely come in handy for those who are looking to talk communicate it. I also wasn't familiar with the words "freegan" and "climatarian", however I now see that my dietary habits are starting to fall under the latter category, something I'm definitely happy about. The meditation author that Ken cited said it best, honestly, and I enjoyed that Ken elaborated on the quote: actively bringing up a topic (especially something that may have odd opinions attached to it, such as meditation and veganism) will likely do more harm and shut down a conversation quickly rather than open the floor to discussion.



<br><hr>
It’s true that when people put the climate crisis in mind, their actions will be automatically regulated. For me, I prefer meat to vegetables. Maybe it is because of my growing family. I believe even right now, most people who become vegans/vegetarians are based on their religious purpose. However, my family members are atheists. And they believed more meat means more nutrition. So because of my family, I like meat so much that I can’t have a meal without meat. Though I knew climate crisis is caused by humans, I have no idea about how many impacts will be caused by the food diet, so I eat meat without guilty. However, since I took this class, my mind is changing. I started to relate the food diet to the climate crisis, I started eating less meat though I still can’t give them up, and I started to share the information with my friends and family. When I go to Portola or Ortega, I prefer chicken to beef, I choose sushi without meat, and I grab less food to avoid wasting. Changing diet is hard, especially for a person who dislikes vegetables, but I’m trying, everyone should try and everyone should put climate crisis in mind.

I completely agree with you that the most important ingredient for good climate activism is effective means of communication. I think that yes, we can change our actions but the hardest part of all of this for me has been figuring out how to get people to care. I think there needs to be a combination of both doing everything you can personally to solve the crisis, but more importantly we must all work to convince the people who do not care like we do the severity of the problem and the steps they can take, however big or small, to help mitigate them. I also agree with you that vegan carries a negative term with it, and I think it is because vegans are usually very passionate and have gained the reputation of being pushy, and meat eaters who do not wish to change their lifestyles do not like this at all. I think Ken’s advice of waiting until your friend brings it up is a good one, but to an extent. I feel like if they never bring it up, then this advice does not really work. However, there are ways of communicating that are better than just telling people why their lifestyles are flat out wrong. I think this just makes them feel threatened, and like Ken said shut off. I think that actions speak louder than words in terms of sparking the seed of those that are interested. I myself am a vegetarian, slowly becoming vegan, and it hurts that these terms have such negative connotations to them, especially when all I am trying to do is help the planet and the animals.

I completely agree with you and the fact that this may be one of the most crucial readings we have been assigned thus far this quarter. One can wish to change all they want, but if they are not willing to put the work into spreading awareness, specifically through activism, their opinions are basically useless. As I said in one of my previous comments, be the change you want to see in the world. This brings us to the topic of veganism and climitarianism.

              <br><br>

You are absolutely right that veganism carries a certain level of stigma. I myself am guilty of this fallacy. I used to constantly poke fun at my friends for choosing to be vegan, the reason being that I felt holding big corporations accountable is a more effective means of preventing climate change. Over the course of this class though, I realized change has to start at the grassroots. Beyond the obvious carbon footprint reduction, it also serves as a means to raise awareness for the cause. This can encourage not only veganism but also climitariansim, which is a much more attractive option for most people. It doesn’t require a major dietary change, yet it is still essential to the fight against climate change. I myself am thinking about trying it out, and hopefully, I possess all the benefits presented in this article.



<br><hr>
I absolutely agree about the importance of this article. Just understanding the material is no longer enough, we also needs the skill of presenting that information, and anyone in this class who is genuinely invested in climate change need to know the skills and tactics for effectively spreading the word. Just saying, "The world is burning," isn't going to turn heads, though I'm sure we all wished it was that easy. I never truly considered the impact of word choice, but Ken's example of vegans really made me realize how much connotation matters in maintaining the discussion. This was such an insightful read and Ken's mentions of freganism and climitarianism really does seem like it could be the way to pave a move towards better dieting and more consciousness towards the environment without sounding too forthright.

I believe this reading works well with the course of this class. Many students felt like everything we were learning was so pessimistic and gave them little hope for our future. However, this reading settled many of those unsettled feelings. This reading has brought a brighter approach to the topic and serves as a sort of guide. Many want an outline and steps they can take in order to follow. This reading definitely helped in that aspect. Although I know our situation needs cold facts and in a way, some alarmism in order for people to feel the pressure to take action, this was a nice change of pace. I can totally relate to the struggle of turning vegan in our society. People feel the need to mock our decision and make it a stereotype which just adds another burden to our transition. I hope many more people become educated on this topic and join the battle.

I agree with Marie that this reading was the most beneficial to the class.  I thought this was an excellent way to introduce how to talk about climate change.  Giving valuable information on how to communicate to the audience of climate change to make an impact on them.  Also, I agree with her comment about this was an overlooked topic because I feel like that is why many people do not get involved in politics because it could be confusing when the politicians are explaining the issues.  This is explained in the reading about how they confuse the audience.  I think that is why I have only a little bit of involvement in political ideas because of the miscommunication.



<br><hr>
Yes, I definitely agree with your comment about how this reading stands out the most because it talks about what we can do to discuss climate change. I think instead of only hitting people with facts as to why it is real and what is it doing, we can easily have a calm conversation about it. Being able to back up facts without getting mad at an Uncle Pete is important to convey the severity of the climate crisis. Bickering back and forth with an Uncle Pete only makes it more difficult unless we use these steps to calmly discuss and counteract wrong arguments with relatable metaphors. I think the doctor metaphor could be very effective and wonder how a climate change denier would try to twist it.
              <br><br>

The second part about Ken's personal experiences, and seeing other people's comments about how they are sometimes criticized or made fun of being vegan surprises me. I think its just because I don't see veganism as something people could want to make fun of, it is difficult to see how or why people would. But still, Ken's method of not pushing veganism or any type of diet or lifestyle on people is so nice to know about him. It is smart of him to only discuss it when people ask him, and knowing now how he goes about sharing his lifestyle choices, makes me more curious and wanting him to discuss it more. A climatarian is a good term I think because it makes people curious, so they ask and then see how it. is doing what you CAN for the environment. It isn't a strict diet or anything, making possible more people want to try it. I think it is a good way to start getting people to eat better for the environment without any pressure.

While reading “bending the curve” I was thinking about how I would speak to my “uncle Pete” and how my last interactions have gone wrong. It sounds a lot easier until you’re actually doing it and becoming frustrated because they refuse to believe the facts. Within my two quarters here at UCSB, I have become extremely passionate about climate change and being aware of my own actions. I think Ken’s mention of being a climatarian is very motivating and something I would call myself. Being Vegan is now seen as “cool” which is amazing, but at the same time, there are many people who enjoy eating meat. I do think that saying you're a vegan at a table of people eating hamburgers makes the conversation very awkward and seems as though you're looking down on them. I went vegan for just a week for other reasons, and I actually enjoyed it. It’s not something I feel like I could do for a lifestyle at this moment, but it did open my eyes to how many tasty meals can be vegan. By being aware myself, I have also made my own roommate aware of the impact and now she also limits her meat intake. I think doing something yourself is very influential and can have an impact on others choices. I do think that “being the change” can cause a ripple effect among others.
              <br><br>

In the reading, I think that the communication methods stated would be very effective. I do think that many people interpret things in different ways so it is important to understand who you are talking to. On another note, making sure you have solutions and plausible ones, is very important. Many times, you will be asked what they can do and might make a stupid comment about being a hippie. At this point, you’ll need to be able to back up your facts with ways that they can still live their modern lifestyles with renewable energy and destigmatize many beliefs about being an activist.

I definitely agree with you in the aspect that more vegan options are becoming available, however, I still think we need to tackle the "cool" aspect of veganism. While I do believe that we are at an upward trend of changing the social connotation of veganism, like what Ken said whenever someone mentions being a vegan the conversation ends. Most of this is due to the fact that vegans tend to overtalk about veganism in any conversation they have. In that sense, I really enjoy the term of being a climatarian, because it takes away the "fad" of veganism and turns the attention towards helping and saving the environment.  

              <br><br>

I really enjoyed that Ken included this reading into the course because I think one of the hardest things with the amount of false information about the climate crisis that is spread throughout the nation. A lot of my family tend to lean on the conservation side of the issue with climate change (I hate that there are political sides to our environment) and sometimes talking to them about what I've learned about the climate and things to do to help have been difficult conversations to have and this article definitely helped me. To accompany the reading, Ken's video was extremely helpful because I know a few people that just talk your ear off about their veganism and that usually makes the people around tune out and disregard the topic in current conversations and later ones. I really appreciated the reading this week.

This week's reading proved to be really enjoyable as it really provided many of us answers to the issues we see today. For example, the 'Uncle Pete' dilemma and how to go about it. The book really helps simplify the issue as those refusing to acknowledge climate change as a scientific issue, instead of regarding it as a political issue. I wish I could really make a change for once.

After had read the article for this week, I have decided that I completely agree with the author. I think that communication is crucial, not only in climate activism, but in all aspects of life. It is important for people to know that it is important to communicate their concerns about the climate crisis to others. Something that I found was really good about this chapter in the book is that it gives people actual methods that they can use to talk about the climate crisis to people that don't believe that climate change is real. I think that this is something that definitely needed to be addressed because it is a real issue. There are a lot of people out there that believe that climate change is a hoax; like the author calls them Uncle Pete. From my own personal experience, I know that talking to people with this mindset is very challenging, as most of the time they refuse to listen and are usually people that are a lot older than me. To be completely honest it can even be a little intimidating, specially when they are older people just refusing to accept that climate change is real. Having methods is very useful because it gives you ideas on how to approach people like this. Something that I thought was really important to point out was that the author mentioned that it was important for the person talking about the climate crisis to know the information and have their facts correct. I think that this is something extremely important as it gives the person credibility. If the person has a lot of knowledge of what they are talking about, it would definitely make Uncle Pete more inclined to believing them and maybe get them to change their minds on their stance on the climate crisis. If this is not the case, and the person does not have accurate facts it will only make Uncle Pete feel more like his stance is correct and the whole thing is a hoax, since not even the person advocating for this knows what they are talking about.

<p>
This week's reading is particularly helpful, I think, as I have many "Uncle Pete"s in my familial circle. Not just on the topic of climate change, but many topics which may not fit their particular ideology. When confronted with their rigid conviction that climate change is a hoax, I am often at a loss as to what to say. How can I possibly hope to show someone a truth which they clearly do not want to believe? The author provides a URL to a very helpful website: skepticalscience.com. This website has a list of skeptic arguments such as "climate's changed before", "it's the sun", and "it's not bad" and hundreds more common arguments used by skeptics to try to explain away the evidence of climate change along with the truth behind these myths. I plan to familiarize myself with these arguments to prepare for the next time I get together with skeptical family members.
              <br><br>


I also like Ken's term "climatarian". I have recently taken to eating more vegetarian and vegan products, along with locally sourced foods in an effort to lower my contribution to climate change. When presented with the option, I choose chicken or turkey over beef, and meat substitute over meat products. I drink almond milk over dairy milk. However, I do not strictly adhere to these habits and do not feel comfortable taking on the title of vegan or pescatarian. I also do not fully subscribe to the strict morals at the heart of the vegan movement, at least not in any consistent and meaningful way. From now on, I think I will go by the term "climatarian". Thank you Ken for expanding my vocabulary!

I love how you are educating yourself and  preparing for future debates with all the "Uncle Petes" in your family! I appreciate how you are not only making a personal effort by becoming a climatarian but also trying to educate and hopefully change other people's stubborn ideologies. Despite potentially confrontational at times, a friendly and well-prepared debate can serve as an appropriate medium to introduce new aspects to the opposition side, as well as, debunk misinformation floating around. I don't know many climate deniers in my life, however, I think the problem I face is that although my friends and family believe in the climate crisis, not many of them know the magnitude of the crisis and the actions to take to mitigate their carbon emissions. Hence, like you, I plan to relay the information and solutions I learn from this course to my friends and family, as education is the best course of action.

I thought that this week’s reading “Communicating Climate Change” by Richard Somerville was very helpful and informative as we have read and watched many versions of an ‘Uncle Pete’ and considered how to most impactfully be a climitarian for the past eight weeks. This chapter lists out and considers many aspects about talking about climate change that have been holding me back from talking about what I have learned throughout the course of this class with my peers, friends and family. I always feel a little uneasy talking about something this debatable without being well versed on the subject matter. But Somerville’s points like the twelve facts, six principles, translating scientific terms and metaphoric examples make me feel more open to the idea of talking about climate change in a way that hopefully won’t attract bashing and weird stares. 
              <br><br>
One thing that came to mind when watching Ken talk about freegans is UCSB’s Dining Commons. Granted that I was a freshman four years ago and have not gone in like two or three years, from what I remember, there were not a lot options for vegetarians (that were different from pizza, pasta and salad) and even less for vegans. Plus, the food waste was very common. Looking back, it was not out of the ordinary to toss half a burrito if it wasn’t good back then. But thinking about it now especially since I cook a lot at home, if everyone did that, I’m sure the food waste was and still is through the roof. It would be interesting to put little reminders about food waste around the dining commons and to provide more plant based options, if there aren’t already.

I agree with you. I feel as though this week's reading, "Communicating Climate Change" by Richard Somerville was also helpful because of how it places many of the thoughts we've been brewing in this course in action. 
              <br><br>
I was surprised that Ken has never mentioned his dietary habits until this video. It makes sense though. You would expect the professor of a course like this to at least be somewhat environmentally conscious of his/her diet. When Ken was talking about freegans and the dining commons at UCSB, I remembered just how much food waste stacked up in places like that. I definitely feel that most people can relate to having that "Uncle Pete" in our lives. They are generally stubborn and don't enjoy being told opinions contrary to their own. I like the idea of being a climatarian as it doesn't necessarily oppose other diets; it's up to you as for how far you take it. I would definitely consider being a freegan or climatarian in the near future. It's an idea that needs more thought on my end.

In this week’s reading, “Communicating Climate Change Science”, I found it enjoyable that stories and metaphors were two aspects of learning how to correctly deal with communicating climate change to others. The story of “Uncle Pete '' was of particular interest to me, because now I can understand that when someone talks about “Uncle Pete '', I will know that they are referring to someone that believes myths and falsehoods regarding climate change. Also, learning about how metaphors can help a climate scientist get their point across when discussing any particular topic. The example given of comparing carbon dioxide to steroids in baseball was something I could understand and relate to how I feel, which was obviously the goal of the metaphor in the first place. Many of the communication ideas discussed in this chapter, including audience, peer review, language, and jargon, were very obvious to me, and it made sense why they should be included in any sort of scientific research. Reversely, stories and metaphors are more specific to communicating climate change science than any other specific science.

When it comes to “Uncle Pete,” I think you touched on a very important point. Not only do we need to approach conversations about climate change carefully when it comes to those with serious doubts, we also need to consider what form of argument or approach we choose to make. For example, as you mentioned, metaphors can play a major role here. Whether it is the steroid/baseball example or even the thermostat example, beginning a discussion on such an important issue with a simple comparison may actually go a long way in changing someone’s mindset. Beyond that, and as Ken touched on in the video, that may also help to mobilize even some of those with major doubts toward making incremental changes. Switching to a turkey burger from a beef burger obviously isn’t the most significant change one can make when it comes to their meal but, because it is more “digestible” so to speak, it is much easier to get people making that sort of change at a massive scale. At the end of the day, I think that is still the most important takeaway from this reading: learning to effectively communicate regarding climate change so that we can inspire and drive change.


<br><hr>

 I enjoyed Jason’s comment about switching from a beef burger to a turkey burger being a small step one can make to reduce their personal carbon emissions. They say Rome wasn;t built in a day, and I compare this with you cannot switch to veganism in a day. For carnivores out there, becoming vegan is going to be a step by step process. Maybe stick with removing red meat from your diet first, then go vegetarian as a little step forward,, and then begin to cut out dairy. Eventually, if one stays on track with this lifestyle change, they will be able to switch to being vegan without feeling so defeated in the beginning. Sometimes we need to start out slow in order to make a bigger impact on reversing climate change.

In this week's reading "Bending the Curve" on communicating climate change, I found the most relation to my current state of home-life. Just this weekend, I was at home gushing to my parents about Ken's class and all the fascinating things I've learned, practices I hope to implement into my life. It was of little to surprise to me that my dad laughed off most of my claims immediately and gave little consideration to the examples I presented. This ruminated greatly in Ken's above video because the topic I focused on most was my intent to become a vegetarian, and that my family members should do the same. As Ken predicted, this was not taken nicely, to say the least. I became the butt of all the jokes for the weekend- every time we were going out to eat I can think of some comment or another made about it. Trust me, I won't make the mistake of openly saying even just that I'm trying to be a vegetarian again. Setting aside my discomfort with the negative public opinion of vegetarian/veganism, I found the communication skills presented in the reading and video to be quite helpful. I liked the reading's idea of starting with background and progressing into details/effects rather than the opposite, and I appreciated the chapter's reminder to become an expert on the subject before trying to educate. I think part of the reason my family doesn't listen much is because when they presented opposition or questions, that I couldn't answer or justify my claims. I enjoyed Ken's suggestions for claiming the title of "climatarian", although I think at least in my family I'd get laughed at for that one even more than vegetarian.

I think this is a really good video which includes almost all the information we discussed before. It briefly tell us about how to do some small things to help protect the environment and try to stop the climate crisis. This can be a very good review for us, but I kind it can be a fantastic introduction for people who don’t really know how to do all what to do. Unfortunately, I think that in the world, there are now more people who don’t know what they should do to help climate crisis. This can be a introduction, because it is short and brief but comprehensive. After watching this one, if the audience find himself interested in some of the point then he can find some ways to get the detailed videos we had before. Thus, people can learn a lot about climate crisis by themselves

I am an editor of Word Magazine here in IV, and one of our writers is working on a piece about having conversations with climate change deniers. His piece focuses on finding commonalities with those we're are told by our political sphere we must disagree with. 
              <br><br>
After this reading, I returned to his draft and found that this sought-after "agreeable" conversation with a denier is neither something I want to see nor something the climate crisis needs. "Uncle Pete" doesn't need someone to politely listen to him as dishes out lie after to lie to protect neoliberal capitalism. Uncle Pete needs someone to tell him he is wrong. Because SCIENCE. And if he continues to argue, after information is calmly and clearly presented to him with apt metaphors and citable sources, there's nothing else we can or should do for him. 
              <br><br>

I thought this week's reading might be helpful for the type of people the author probably works with -- scientists who have plenty of information but no communication skills necessary to present it. But in terms of communication skills I personally want to work on, Ken's video was a lot more helpful. It's not just that I don't run into deniers often, its that (and maybe this is bad, I don't know) -- I REALLY don't want to waste time talking to them. I have spent so many hours just in this quarter so far, in this class and in others, watching/reading/learning about the devastating effects of this climate crisis. I'm sad, angry, and scared. The last thing I want to do is argue with someone over whether or not the FACTS are true. I feel the U.S. has extended a ridiculous amount of courtesy to these people, and enough is enough. People are in danger and dying, species are going extinct, natural wonders are disappearing, and things are only getting worse -- I just don't care about polite conversations anymore. 
              <br><br>

However in terms of what Ken was saying, I think it is definitely worthwhile to think about how we plan on communicating activism to the people who are on our side. While it is probably the case for most of us that the majority of our friends believe in climate change, many of them probably aren't doing much about it. And its true, strangely, that no one likes "that one activist friend." Unfortunately, people will just stop listening to you if you talk their ear off all day about activism (if it takes that long for them to stop listening). Communicating political action to our circles is an art form, and as Ken said, it must be done subtly yet powerfully.

I thought Somerville's chapter in "Bending the Curve" may have been one of the most important reads in general.  As Ken has expressed time and time again, the problem with climate change is not so much as scientific, but cultural and, I would say, political as environmental activists struggle to gain a majority to pass legislation and to encourage environmentally friendly alternatives.  However, it is difficult to convince many people about environmental awareness when some activists taint the image of the group by means of bad arguing skills.  The chapter, "Communicating Climate Chance Science" can solve this problem as it can separate the activists who sound like they don't know what they are talking about from the activists who can effectively communicate the subject to convince others.  A growing trend seen within both political parties is someone with a platform picking on uneducated individuals or individuals who are have no experience with arguing to represent a whole group.  Somerbille's chapter can help combat against the abuse of this logical fallacy in regards to climate change as it explains how anyone can easily argue for the truth as it is backed by more than sufficient evidence.

The reading "Bending the Curve: Climate change Solutions" works to give a guide to disprove the claims made by climate change deniers, or those claiming that climate change is a hoax. The chapter is broken up into five sections including preparation, stories, metaphors, language, and solutions. Instead of debating and arguing with climate change deniers, educating and discussing the issue is a much better way to communicate the information. Communicating the proper information to people is the most important thing we can all do because there are a lot of people who are misinformed or just don't have enough information regarding the climate crisis to truly solidify their position and understanding on the climate crisis. 
              <br><br>
The video discusses freegans and "climatarians", new terms to describe people who want to reduce their carbon footprint by eating food that has been thrown out or food that will be least harmful to the environment. Being a freegan or a climatarian seems appealing because there isn't such a strict adherence to a diet, it is simply trying to reduce a consumer lifestyle in terms of food and eating meals that are less harmful towards the environment, which I am already trying to implement into my life.

In my case, the “uncle Pete” of my story is one of my high school English teachers. So many of Uncle Pete’s arguments are the same ones my english teacher used. I vividly remember him saying something along the lines of climate change being “an opportunity for the government, and for liberals and environmentalists, to make rules and regulations, to interfere with markets, and to diminish the personal freedom of individuals.” I was definitely bummed to learn he’s a climate denier because I consider him such an intelligent man and great teacher. One of bigger lessons was personal freedom and how power lies in the individual rather than a collective. He gave examples like Ford: thanks to motorized cars, we are better off today (in terms of “efficiency,” of course).  “If you let people keep more of their money, they will invest it in the future” was another of his arguments. People are selfish and look after our own best interest, so rich people will indeed invest, but in THEIR future. “They don’t expect that a simple bandage will cure a potentially fatal disease” illustrates the severity of the situation we are in. It’s important to acknowledge the problem, and aid in its solution. Changing our light bulbs and taking quicker showers is a joke of a solution when fossil fuels are the problem.

I have met my fair share of "uncle Petes" in my life as well. One which stuck with me the most was a coworker at the Emergency Department who told me that the climate change movement is blown out of proportion. He then drew a comparison to the 2005 Disney movie "Chicken-Little" in that our generation attempts to raise panic about climate change when there is no real life threat present. I believe that many of the older generations have this same conclusion to the climate change movement. This ignorance is founded from the lack of knowledge, or maybe even deeper, a lack of care. One of the first things that Ken said in this course was that in lieu of all the terrifying figures and depressing statistics that predict our planet's fate, he held hope for the people of this world when they are inevitably faced with the reality of an existential threat by climate change. That in the 11th hour, we will pull through. Such a daunting issue should not be procrastinated on. But this holds evident that action will only be achieved when the effects of climate change are right under our noses, as if they weren't already. I feel like the world is just closing their eyes at this point.

"Climate change is much more than a scientific topic. I am convinced that confronting climate change is fundamentally a moral and ethical issue." This is something that I truly believe is the issue that divides people along the lines of climate change. The whole "Uncle Pete" thing makes everything so much clearer in the sense that there will always be those people you know that will always doubt the reality behind climate change, but "Uncle Pete" has to become a person of the past. It was probably a lot easier to be an Uncle Pete years ago when our science was still developing and new findings were being materialized into the minds of the common people. But today, our technology is more exact. Our science is more exact. If you believe in science today, Uncle Pete's have to become a thing of the past. Climate change is not just the earth's issue; it's our issue too. And we all share the issue and the possible consequences that can occur. That's why denying/agreeing with the reality of climate change is so important to unifying the people as one. One of our issues is now all of our issues, regardless of how you view anthropogenic climate change. But it's important to be cooperate and be tolerant of other's perspectives.

“Climate change is much more than a scientific topic. I am convinced that confronting climate change is fundamentally a moral and ethical issue. It involves considerations of intergenerational equity.”

              <br><br>

I really appreciated this insight presented in chapter 8 of “Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions” because it aligns with the generational blockades Ken has discussed in lecture and previous videos. When confronted with someone of an older generation who has a drastically different line of thinking than yourself, it is important to envision their perspective. This reading was especially helpful for providing different methods of communication when informing about climate change. For example, the author shares how utilizing metaphors and stories is a strong communication booster; the comparison of climate change to steroids was eye-opening for me. Rather than immediately taking on a condescending, disappointed tone with climate change deniers, it may be more effective to play with language to make the conversation less serious and judgmental. 

              <br><br>

Additionally, I respect the text’s introduction including points about catering to your audience. When we participate in many life experiences, we use impression management by adjusting our personality according to the situation and people we’re surrounded by, such as being more conserved with family and more carefree with close friends. In a similar manner, we should carefully choose what impression we want to evoke during climate change discussion in order to be the most persuasive.

I agree with your statement about the importance of the phone used in. the work. In my reading experience and looking through the other comments on here, a commonality is that Chapter 8 was actually enjoyable to read. The tone didn't paint an overly pessimistic view of the Climate Crisis, but did not lose the urgency of the situation. Additionally it used metaphors and other types of figurative language to balance the scientific jargon and hold the. readers attention. It is an interesting approach as compared to other works we've read this year, for example. Whether or not that this approach is more effective I can't say. While I enjoyed the read and found the content relevant and a unlike others we have read before,  I don't know if it did too good a job convincing me why we need to recruit more moderate. minded people. NOT that I think we shouldn't, I just would have expected that the authors would find that argument on the importance of recruitment so we can vote more important. Maybe I missed it or it was in a previous chapter? Overall, I believe this chapter might be one of the most useful we've read so far in terms of application in our lives outside of school. and this class.

I really enjoyed reading Communicating Climate Change Science more than I expected. There were many characteristics of the text which I found to be very effective. Its well organized structure and use of the fictional embodiment of the climate change doubter "Uncle Pete" allow the reader to better visualize and understand the message. One thing in particular from this article which I found to be extremely helpful was the steroid analogy. Although the text asserted that this was a well known metaphor, I had never heard it before. The similarities between steroids and CO2 and their respective effects on performance and the world, depicts a tremendous image. Additionally, i think the metaphor can be expanded upon to include the negative effects of steroids. To elaborate, much like the use of steroids, exploitation of fossil fuels and emissions of CO2 does provide short term benefits for the well being of the world; it provides cheap energy for production and DOES stimulate the economy. However, long term use of either will ultimately cause an adverse outcome. While this metaphor is helpful, I truely had an epiphany when I read the authors comparision of global temerature rises to that of a fever. For me, communicating the drastic impact of a mere 2 degrees of temperature rise was always rather difficult, especially when my own "uncle Pete" would constantly refute that climate fluxiates across a 10-20 degree range in the span of a year in one of the most moderate global climate zones. Once likened to a fever, it is much more readily accepted that a small difference could have a drastic impact on our planet. And, much like the body, the earth is essentially a group of systems which must opperate at the optimal temperature to which it has adapted to fit.

I have organized on campus all four of my years here. Chapter 8 of Bending the Curve: Climate Change solutions explains many tactics that I have learned from the organizations I have been in. For example, preparation is very essential for engaging in communication with people. In order for others to be aware of an issue, they need to understand what is going on. It is difficult to present something that isn’t delivered clearly to the audience. In addition, language is something that should also always be taken into consideration; many people may not know some of the jargon that is used and as a result, not be able to fully understand, feel alienated, or discouraged from helping out or joining a movement. I would like to add on that clarifying and refreshing what is going on or what a specific movement is to others would help listeners feel in the loop. Solutions are extremely important in communicating not only the climate crisis but also other issues to people. There is not really a point in bringing up a devastating or important issue without having or even coming up with solutions. All important movements must require solutions, otherwise there would not be enough fuel for people to follow through with it. Another communication strategy of importance that professor Ken made me think about is speaking without feelings of moral superiority. I was reminded of this when he brought up that people may associate vegans with having feelings of moral superiority. It is contradictory to speak to a person about an issue in a condescending manner because movements are meant to include as many people; they are for the masses, not the few. We cannot alienate people who are interested in learning about something,
              <br><br>

One final communication strategy that professor Ken indirectly mentioned is talking to others one on one. He mentioned that people approach him when they have a question about one of his practices. Talking to individuals one on one has to be one of the most efficient strategies that people may overlook. People are able to understand each other clearer, express concerns, and build trust by having such conversations. For example, for the COLA movement happening UCwide, one of the grad students communicated to us at a grad student meeting that talking to people one on one can be one of theeasiest and effective ways of contributing to the movement (and other movements as well).

After reading, “Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions” I was pleased to see actual communication methods to spread awareness of the climate crisis. There are many people in my life who distrust the government and scientists because they don’t understand them. Politicians and scientists alike use jargon that is recognizable for the educated but not for the majority of the world’s population who are not. I actually looked this up, only 6.7% of the world’s population is college educated. Only 6.7%! This obviously needs to change but on with this week’s reading. I let out a laugh at the author’s analogical figure, Uncle Pete. I have an Uncle Pete, however, I refer to him as my Tio Emmanuel. My Tio Emmanuel is a Trump supporting, conservative, religious, pro-life, climate skeptic, carnivore and gun enthusiast. Yes, we argue a lot. From immigration reforms to climate crisis I have laid out the facts before him yet it seems like he will never change. I respect Republican and conservative ideology but I try to make him see that his way of thinking is going to drastically affect his children. He argues that technology will solve everything and that climate change is a Democrat’s hoax to win election votes. Thus quite frankly, I was tired of explaining my thoughts to him. That was before I read this week’s readings on how to communicate climate crisis topics to the general audience. By being a climatarian you can inspire people to make more eco friendly choices. I liked Ken’s statement, “You’re not telling people to stop eating that pizza. But to decide to get one covered in veggies than three different kinds of meat.” Climatarianism can inspire people to make the bridge to becoming pescetarian, vegetarian or vegan. Freeganism is even better by promoting anti-capitalist and anti-consumerist while also being flexible. Freeganist make the conscious choice to eat food instead of throwing it in the trash. I believe all these ideologies are great and I greatly aspire to be a vegan one day, what I like about these thoughts are that they have the planet in mind. We often buy, eat and travel without a second thought. But climatarianists and freeganists make the conscious choice that we should all be making.

I definitely relate to you when you talk about your Tio Emmanuel. I think we all have an Uncle Pete and mine is my aunt Lara. She's the same as your uncle and it's hard to tell your relatives, especially those who are older than you, otherwise or that they're wrong. Reading “Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions," helped me guide me to better communicate with our uncle Pete's. I liked how the book is simple yet elaborative at the same time. It brought up basic points I felt that almost everyone should know: Preparation, stories, metaphors, language, and solutions. I was pleasantly surprised when reading these sections because it made me look at communication in a different way. My favorite section was metaphor because I actually haven't heard the "CO2 is the steroids our of climate." I think that using metaphors when talking about climate change is effective especially when trying to get people to understand climate change in a different light.

Regarding Ken's video, my mom has been vegan for about 20 years now. First, she was vegetarian, then switched to becoming a vegan. She always cooks vegan food and tried to encourage my siblings and me to try being vegan or at least vegetarian. While we love her cooking, it wasn't quite enough to get us to make the switch. I did like your comment about what Ken said because it's true. Everyone starts somewhere. Starting with being educated on our ongoing climate change. I like the idea of freeganism as well. We are being aware of our actions instead of being forced into a lifestyle.. I do hope to be like my mom one day and possibly a freeganism.

Hi, Ortiz, I totally agree with your comment after reading"“Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions' ' and watching Ken's video. It's so exciting that communication on environmental protection between people becomes more and more. It means there is an increasing number of people who realize the terrible result of pollution. For example, the Australian wildfire, the Coronavirus, tsunami, tornado, earthquake and so on. Recently, I have heard from the news that as global warming is becoming worse, the ice on the Himalaya is melting, and it might release many new kinds of virus that we have never seen before. I was so scared after I heard this, because I understand that life is so weak when confronting some unknown virus, we are basically killing ourselves as we release tons of pollution and slaughter all kinds of animals. I believe the natural world are waiting for its chance to take revenge. Ken said one sentence that really touches me is "Before you want to change the world, you will need to change yourself first, or you will cause many troubles", I heard my parents speak that all the time, and I'm still learning from this quote today,

Thank you for bringing in your Tio Emmanuel, I too have various people in my family who are so stubborn, cold hard facts cannot even change their opinions. Although I can (sometimes) respect their opinions, it's difficult when they try to belittle my opinions by calling me a "snowflake" or social justice warrior. I never understood why the term social justice warrior has turned into a degrading one, but it seems that most people attempt to discredit your opinions simply because they see that we swing left. I found this reading to be the most helpful this course. I have changed my diet, life style, and try my best to be a climate activist when possible, but what I find most difficult is communicating with the opposing side because it is apparent that their opinions are not based in reality. I liked what the reading stated; one is entitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to their own facts. I honestly overlooked many of the things stated in the article. It seems almost intuitive to start off with all the convincing facts about climate change to show Uncle Pete the severity of climate change, but it makes sense why so much complicated jargon might turn him away all together. This is what many politicians do. While they might think that their policies are most clear when they address them with the proper terms, it's important to know your audience. Only about 1/3 of Americans have at least a bachelor's degree. It will be difficult to get that other 2/3 of the population to vote for legislation if they can't understand what the legislation means.
              <br><br>

The reading also surprised me when it talked about small things like just changing word choice when discussing the climate. When I hear about the positive feedback loop in global warming, I immediately think of the tipping point. But to someone who is not as knowledgeable on the climate, it makes sense that they would associate it with decreasing temperatures. 
              <br><br>

Climate change is a difficult topic to discuss. A 2 degrees celsius change doesn't sound like a lot; it sounds like natural fluctuation in temperature. But people don't understand the detrimental consequences on a global scale. It's important for us to use this knowledge to educate whose beliefs are not based in reality.

I think it was quite interesting to pair this reading with this video. I completely see the link between Ken's talk about eating habits and how to talk to people about them. Telling us to not advertise our eating habits and instead wait for people to ask about them (or any other eco-friendly habit or lifestyle we may have adopted, for that matter) is a fantastic example for how to communicate climate science and climate action. I greatly appreciate Ken's video on this since I learned about how to better communicate to people about the climate crisis, which is one of the most essential things to learn in this class since it is about tackling the climate crisis from a social science standpoint. However, I think the reading could have been a bit better. The author noted some really good tips and strategies for how to talk to people about climate science and used good examples from their life and experiences as a climate science (and their fellow climate science colleagues' experiences). In that way, the reading was very effective and informative. However, the reading struck me as a bit hypocritical. The author wrote about communicating climate science in a good way, but their writing strategies didn't follow their own advice. The only way I can think of the actual writing style as not hypocritical is if the intended audience was only fellow climate scientists, in which case I am the wrong audience and my criticisms can be blamed on that. The author became condescending toward the end. They started to write about scientists as if they were the best people in the world and everyone else was simply there to be pawns in scientists' goal of communicating or as people who only exist to annoy scientists. Writing with this sense of supposed superiority is very off-putting to everyone who is not in their community (which is most people). The style of writing completely missed the most important part of communicating: viewing others as fellow humans during interactions, not just as targets in a goal.

“Communicating Climate Change Science” (Chapter 8) is a very important chapter in the art of communicating and discussing a controversial topic. Being intentional with your knowledge and the way communicate is going to be way more effective than just throwing every bit of information you know at someone. Really listening to where the person you are talking to is at and what bit of information could benefit them. Ultimately people aren’t going to hear you if they don’t want to, so there is no point in shaming or participating in a debate with them. Communicating in a more calm educational way will make way more of a difference then contributing to the extremist image people have of activists. 

              <br><br>

Ken’s personal anecdote about how he communicates with his friends at dinner is something I really connect with. I never bring up my diet lifestyle because it is something personal for me and I only want to share and discuss with people who want to hear because that is where the biggest difference can be made. I like the simple steps on how to communicate well as well as the encouragement to know facts and stories to better explain this crisis to people, my favorite example being the ice age example.

I agree with your point about people not listening to you if they choose not to listen. I have had so many friends who asked me advice on certain aspects but in the end, they disregard my advice even if they know it’s the better option simply because they don’t want to. I get really mad when people ask me for my advice and don’t take it seriously because then what was the point of asking me. I just wasted my time helping someone through their problems and in the end, they don’t take it seriously and laugh it off. Similarly to what Ken said about mediation and giving your thoughts, you should just simply wait for the best moments until people are ready to hear the truth. Although I think this way is more passive, there are no ways to talk to people unless they are ready to hear how reality is. I do agree with this way but I also feel that there should be a way to communicate with others before it gets too late to even do anything. In this week’s reading, it taught readers different ways to communicate with someone who is simply too adamant on fake facts. I think this chapter was a good way to help people who do not understand what climate change is but it also doesn’t tell you ways when the conversation isn’t going well. The author of this book just assumes that the conversation with “Uncle Pete” will be a calm debate but I know family members that simply cannot deal with being wrong. Even if they’re arguing the wrong facts, they will argue until the other person gets tired and assume they won the debate. I wish there were more tips to talk to these types of people without getting even angered and wanting to end the conversation.
              <br><br>


I never ask people’s eating habits unless they want to tell me because I personally feel that if someone keeps on questioning your food habits, it’s like they’re forcing you to them so they can secretly judge and compare themselves to your habits. I think people have to be more understanding of people’s food choices because I know people who are very judgemental if others eat something different than they do.

Another reading that actually made me feel hopeful and guided through the most “basic” ideas and solutions towards combating climate change. Chapter 8 of “Communicating Climate Change Science covers is like a mini-course on how to go about explaining or better yet conveying the topic of climate change onto others. The chapter covers how it is stories and metaphors are used to better relay the issue at hand but most interesting to me was the section comparing public language to scienctifc language. This was especially important for me to note as I use plenty of the words listed on a weekly basis, at times while trying to explain a scientific perspective but hadn’t realized how different of meanings they held. Also important to take away from this week’s reading is the solutions section, the book highlights that climate change science has been backed up and proven time after time so the question “is it real” should no longer be the focus rather a “how can we help” perspective should be held. This point is emphasized with a point I agree with, “Whether to act to limit global warming to tolerable levels should not depend on your politics. We have only one Earth.” I’d also encourage anyone reading this comment to take a look at the Ten solutions (six clusters, three levers and ten solutions) in chapter 4, an understandable pathway towards combatting climate change, where I personally believe this class to be part of solutions #2, societal transportation and awareness of our negative cultural habits. 
              <br><br>


As for the video, the concept of “climatearianism” seems like the best way to combat the consequences of our eating habits via a more sustainable diet without the shaming of other’s choices. I find that a lot of the reason many of my own friends choose not to go vegan or vegetarian is not solely the fact that they enjoy eating animal products but also subliminal belief that they are giving into an “annoying” or overly-radical movement. I feel as though more people would consider changing their diet if there wasn’t a stigma around choosing either side, similarly to the way people shame people for what they eat, I think some resist because of that inner idea of “being told what to do”. Again, I think when changing diets or giving people an insight as to why they should change theirs, shame isn’t the way to go about the situation, instead guiding peoples curiosity towards the benefits they and the planet can have is more likely to result in a permanent change or interest.

I too felt inspired about the solutions and ways to better confront the climate crisis! I feel communication is often an overlooked topic when discussing the climate crisis which is crazy to me. I feel the real change will come when people on opposing sides of the topic can come together and rather than attack each other, can actually communicate their concerns, doubts, and solutions. I totally agree that the part about scientific language with jargon and general language can make all the difference. I feel the climate crisis is an issue so big as it includes all of the world should be communicated in ways that not only scientific geniuses can understand.


<br><hr>
I agree, I appreciated how this reading focused on how to share information to make learning about/getting educated on climate change more accessible to a broader group of people. My main complain with a lot of the readings/solutions that we've been given so far is that they are all good and useful, but either the way they are phrased or the actions they suggest are not accessible to a lot of people- so this reading was super helpful and important I feel.  I also like the point you made about the solutions section- I think viewing the climate crisis as thinking about how we can solve it rather than whether or not it's real is a better and much more productive perspective to hold. 
              <br><br>
I think climatearianism is an interesting idea, and I feel like it's a lot easier than some of the other lifestyle changes we've discussed. It just involves putting in a conscious effort to make sure the food you eat and what you consume is ethically sourced, having a small carbon footprint. Generally, this also leads to a much healthier and well-rounded diet, making not only the environment more healthy, but you as well. I think it is an interesting and impactful approach at combating climate change.


<br><hr>
I completely agree. I feel like the greatest issue we face today in the climate debate has to do with communication. So many scientists are misunderstood because of a language barrier, in this case, scientific language. The fossil fuel companies are benefiting from this barrier by using other people to take advantage of it. The climate deniers are so effective because they know how to persuade and how to inspire doubt among the masses. In order to increase our odds of positive change, we must learn how to effectively communicate with others.  While I was reading, I realized that a had made several of the mistakes the author warned against. This class provides me with so much information and knowledge that by the end of it, it basically becomes word-vomit because I'm just so excited to share everything I know with my family. I didn't realize that by giving too much information at once was hindering their ability to actually understand what I was saying. I also have a habit of thinking that facts or science is enough, but Chapter 8 reminded me that the general public instead needs a story or analogy to get their attention. I focus too much on the data than actually considering who my audience is. I think out of everything I read or watched for this class, this reading has been the most helpful. It really did feel like a crash course, and now I am better equipped at communicating the climate crisis.
              <br><br>
I think becoming a climatarian or freegan is the best and most realistic solution to the food issue. A lot of people have become dependent on having meat in their diet, so telling them to become a vegan won't be very helpful. However, if we can tell them to instead choose food with a lower climate footprint (like chicken over beef), then we will definitely see people become far more willing to participate in this type of personal action. Even becoming a freegan is easy when compared to being a vegan or vegetarian. In being a freegan, all you really have to do is limit the amount of food waste. Whether that be dumpster diving, serving yourself less food, or eating leftovers, these small changes are much easier to implement into our daily lives than completely cutting out red meat.

Hi Esteban! I agree with what you said--I thought the reading was insightful and could prove to be of use for many people. I actually took the class this textbook is from last quarter. We never used the textbook so I didn't even know it existed, but I really enjoyed the easy-to-read format and the extended "Uncle Pete" metaphor put the situation in a perspective that I think many of us have encountered at least once when trying to communicate about the climate crisis. Something I've been thinking about lately is why people feel unmotivated to take action despite knowing the severity of the climate crisis? I think I've come to the conclusion that it has to do A LOT with how we communicate about the climate crisis. Oftentimes, those of us who are advocating for climate action may not know how to refute counterpoints/myths from those who are skeptical which is why I really appreciated that Somerville actually included websites for readers to check out. Moreover, I liked how there was an emphasis on solutions and how we can communicate them. A lot of times when we talk about the climate crisis, we talk about how detrimental it'll be to our environment and to our society, so it can leave feelings of hopelessness in many people. It's important to remember that we have the technology, we have the solutions--it's a matter of strategically communicating the issue to elicit action and hope in people. 
              <br><br>

In terms of "climatarianism," I also agree with you. I consider myself a climate activist, but I really don't think I could go vegan. Even before listening to Ken's lecture, I have been trying to be conscious of how much meat I eat and choose alternatives like chicken or turkey. In that sense, I'd consider myself a climatarian. I think this would be appealing too because many people are looking for ways to take personal action, but couldn't go vegan for cultural/personal/other reasons and this could provide a good, conscious alternative.




<br><hr>
This reading was also a very useful course for me on how to explain the climate crisis. I often find myself trying to use language I don't fully understand, but continue to do so because I want whoever I'm talking to get the idea right away. This reading made me realize I don't even have a full understanding of climate change. I also tend to talk about climate change in a negative way, leaving out the hope. This reading helped me understand that facts and numbers are more important that my beliefs. If I can't back it up, it means nothing and whoever I'm speaking with can't trust that I know what I'm talking about.




<br><hr>
I also felt hopeful after reading this chapter, as, as you mentioned, it covered basics on how to promote conversation about climate change with others. I think this is something powerful that we can all do, as we are taking this class and are being equipped with the right knowledge to teach other people. I really like how you pointed out that in the reading, it stated that there is no point in talking about whether or not climate change is real anymore, as it has proven time and again that human impact is the main source for climate change. Instead, we should be focusing on how we can do to help. This is a really powerful point that was made in the chapter, so I’m really glad you brought it up in your comment. This way, we are encouraging taking action to help climate change, versus debating over the already answered question of whether or not climate change is real. As Ken mentioned in the video, when discussing the topic of climate change with friends, they likely are not skeptics of climate change. Thus, there is no point in discussing whether or not climate change is happening, and it is better to focus on what we can all do to create change. 
               <br><br>
Regarding the topic of climatearianism that Ken mentioned, I also believe that it is a really good way to encourage change. I think why some people reject the idea of veganism so much is because of how they communicate the idea to others. Of course the moral concept behind their choices are very admirable, but can come off as preachy and condescending if not executed correctly. I think it is lovely that Ken mentioned ways to bring up the topic without conveying it that way, because, as you mentioned, sometimes people feel as if they are being told what to do when the topic of veganism comes up. I also like how Ken mentioned ways to create curiosity towards the topic by mentioning different terms that people would be curious about. That way, they are also invested into the conversation and oftentimes, they are willing to learn about these different diets. Overall, I found this reading and lecture to be very powerful.

I totally agree with you! This reading did make me feel hopeful especially while reading the solution section. I like that the text mentioned we should always provide information for solutions because no one likes to hear about hopelessness. It's true, if people are told of solutions it will help influence their behavior to make a change for the better. We do need political action to be made and that's why it's important to spread the word to friends to encourage them to vote. I like that the text mentioned that choosing not to do something is also making a choice in that it leads to climate change impacts on future generations. We need to not only think about ourselves but the lives of future generations. If we have the power to change and prevent something, why not take action and prevent others from suffering. I also liked when the text mentioned that regardless of your political views you should still listen to the science and see that regardless of what you believe, the data shows climate change is happening and we have only one Earth. I totally agree with that and think that people should see the data and realize this is happening and we need to do something about it.



<br><hr>
As you mentioned, this reading was much more hopeful than those that we focused on in the beginning of the quarter. There have been times throughout this course that I felt like combating climate change was too great of a goal. There were too many barriers, it relied too much on collective efforts to be more conscious of climate footprints as well as action in an extremely partisan government in the US. However, reading this chapter gave me tools to talk about the climate and create change within my sphere of influence.
               <br><br>


Now, I have a new perspective on how to approach telling those around me about climate change. The scientific vs vernacular word choice part was very interesting as you mentioned. The most impactful portion to me came from Ken’s video when he spoke on the fact that we shouldn’t take initiative when talking about climate change. Instead, we should live lives that mirror our beliefs about climate change and the pressing need we as a society have to fix our mistakes. I made the error of being too forward with climate action beliefs. My uncle was talking to me about school a couple weeks ago and I mentioned English 23 and what we were learning, perhaps a little too earnestly. He replied with “College is too liberal these days,” and that was the end of our conversation. 
               <br><br>


In other situations, however, I’m better about letting my actions speak for themselves. Similar to Ken, when I go out to eat with friends it would become obvious that I’m vegetarian when ordering food. My friends would ask me how long I’ve been a vegetarian, how I got my protein, and why I became a vegetarian. I would then politely answer them, not by telling them that they were making unethical decisions by eating meat, but educating them on the negative impacts of the animal agriculture business. After reading this chapter, I know that this strategy is the most effective.

While yes I felt that the chapter we read offered very basic ways to communicate ideas and solutions toward Climate change, I honestly thought it was incredibly boring.  I felt like it had little impact and that there was not much info i walked out with. On the other hand, I found Kens short youtube video to be very interesting. I had never heard of climatarians or freegans. When Ken was explaining what climatarianism was It described nearly perfectly to how I try to eat. Being vegan comes with a harshly negative label, its always a bit intimidating for me to mention my eating habits to others because I am unaware of their views and/or i dont want them to feel like I'm targeting them out or trying to put guilt on them in any way. I can realistically see myself picking up the term climatarianism. I think it is such a better way to communicate my values, while I really eat this way for the climate and not for other reasons. Although of course there is always gonna be people who are gonna feel judged or attacked as well. I still do think it is a better way to communicate values and hopefully help people become more conscious of their lifestyle.



<br><hr>

I too found this chapter to be extremely helpful in looking at new/better ways to explain/ discuss climate change with others. I actually recently had a discussion with a friend about eating a vegan diet and they kept arguing that they did not think that veganism was sustainable (they thought people would not be able to get enough nutrients) or that it was actually necessarily an ethical problem if one made sure to only buy meat products from responsible sources. We spent about 20 minutes total discussing it (before we both decided not to continue), I tried to argue that veganism is a sustainable lifestyle as it is both good for the individual and for the planet. This person does believe in climate change but I still think the tips in the reading and video would have been helpful in the discussion. I shall definitely try to use them in the future.



<br><hr>

While reading your comment, I feel that I shared a lot of similar sentiments regarding this week’s reading. I think Chapter 8 of Bending the Curve effectively engages readers in the material, providing simple explanations of the validity of the climate crisis and going on to suggest how to get this information across to climate deniers. In the section on Language, I found it to be notable how the author described “scientific jargon.” Before seeing the chart that directly compares the scientific versus colloquial meanings of various words, I hadn’t really thought about how it would be difficult to convey a message to the public when their personal definitions of certain scientific terms would skew any message presented to them. This reminded me of the concept of “bedside manner,” in regards to doctors explaining information to patients. It is critical that doctors can effectively get across information to patients in a way that is clear and succinct, presenting a problem without inciting panic and then going on to present all plausible solutions. This is exactly how the climate crisis must be communicated to the public. 

               <br><br>

As I continued reading your comment, I resonated with what you had to say about making personal changes without putting down the choices of others. The climate crisis will not be solved on the grounds of shaming inaction. Grappling with this concept, I was reminded of a video I watched a while back called “6 Vegans Vs. 1 Secret Meat Eater,” a segment of the series “Odd Man Out” on the Youtube account Jubilee. In the series, a group of people is brought together to try a weed out the one person who does not fit into their assigned category, which is being vegan in this case. In the video, I recall there was one woman who was so adamantly vegan that she shames everyone else who doesn’t fit her standards for veganism. She ends up isolating everyone else in the group, generating resentment from viewers, and reinforcing a lot of negative stereotypes about vegans. I feel that a lot of climate change activists end up engaging this type of communication when trying to bring about change in regards to the climate crisis, a method that is entirely counterproductive. This means of communication will only work positively with people who already believe in climate change, which is not the group that needs to be convinced.



<br><hr>
I also really appreciated how this reading was a crash course in understanding the climate crisis. I believe that a lot more people should have to read readings like this because it would help us all engage more frequently in more meaningful dialogue regarding the climate crisis. Often people close off when you start to talk science to them because they may not understand, they may not believe in it, or they may have political ideaology against it, but if you can break down the science into simple terms, eventually you wont even have to talk science, you can simply talk about protecting the planet. And this leads me to the amazing quote that you pulled - "Whether to act to limit global warming to tolerable levels should not depend on your politics. We have only one Earth.” I think this is the most imporant quote to highlight becuase we have already wasted so much time arguing one way or another on climate change that we have almost left it too late to do anything about it, and saving it is our only option. Ultimately we have to turn around and start to protect this planet at some point, but whether we decide to do that now or debate it until it is too late is the vital question.
               <br><br>

Furthermore, I also agree with what you said about diets and “climatarianism.” I came to Santa Barbara from a very small, conservative town. There were only a few vegans there but these vegans made this little club who went around school just telling everyone they were vegan as if anyone really understood. This group seemed to do it for the fad and just so they could tell everyone all the time that they were vegan - it was a little annoying. I came to school here and I am now very close with a lot of vegan people who do it for the environment, who don’t feel the need to tell you they are vegan, but quietly set an example. When asked why they decided to go vegan they explain, without shaming, how the vegan diet helps the envrionment. This is was something I had never been exposed to but I apprecated, and this has made a huge impact in my decision to start trying to change my diet. Sometimes seeing the change being made and setting the example is the way to create larger social movement.




<br><hr>
I really agree with your idea that what Ken said about “climatearianism” is really a good way to communicate and persuade others to try or even change to largely plant based diet originally by tell them the effect and why. For everyone, in the world, a person must have sOme kind of curiosity or interest in new things or fancy terms. As we say terms like “climatearianism”, normally, others may want to know at least what it is. This can easily give us a chance to inform them all the things about climate crisis and what the largely plant based diet can do to help it. This can be much better than just say I am a vegan. 
               <br><br>

 In my pernicious comments I always say something about the importance of informing the public about the truth of climate crisis to let them act immediately. However, I never actually thought about how to inform them and how to let them trust that the things we said are the fact. After reading the this chapter, I realize the importance of communicating methods and the way we inform other can even be more important than the action itself. Anyway, I think it is really good to have videos, courses, and reading let these to at least let some of the people know t he truth about climate crisis.

I would say that I totally agree with the points you made. This week’s reading, "Communicating the Climate Change Science”, was probably on my top3 favorite reading list. It not only refreshes my mind about how necessary it is to communicate with others who don’t believe the climate crisis is real, but it also teaches me lessons of the ways to effectively communicate with them. One thing that I found this chapter practical is that it actually offers us, “believers” of the climate crisis, many tips that we could refer to when having conversations with those “non-believers”, like the book “Uncle Pete”. As far as I am concerned, it is of importance that there are articles like this out there dealing with this kind of issue and taking it into account. Many elders from my family are still doing what is right based on their tarnished and outdated thoughts in the aspect of the environment, like overusing plastic bags, burning dead branches outside, and throwing everyday’s trash around, which are definitely damaging the environment more and making the situation worse. For the sake of the land we live, the climate crisis is in need of everyone’s help, every single one of us. After reading this week’s reading, I think we could be the first ones to do that.

               <br><br>

Also, I should really give credits to Ken’s video, which serves as a great supplementary to the reading and further consolidates my understanding. The concepts of climatarians and freeganism are totally revolutionary to me since I’ve never heard of them and they are explaining the way of life on a whole another level. I could clearly see how eating habits are the game-changers and a switch on our diets could make that much impact.

The idea of climatarian sounds actually really useful and interesting. I would need much more statistics or fact checks to be more certain about the things I try to educate my friends with. This is similar to using metaphors like what the reading called for. If I could somehow incorporate climate crisis with what I do every day with my friends like instead of saying I am going to the library, I would say something like going to the LEED certified building over there. Though this is less of a metaphor more just a change in the name.
               <br><br>
I think the part about baiting individuals into being interested in the subject could actually very helpful. Also, the part on only telling people about climate change and crisis when they ask for it is applicable to all aspects of life. It totally makes sense that if they did not ask you, then they don't wanna know. But much like racism, sexism, and more -isms, climate crisis is one that needs to be talked about as widely as possible. We often need to hear before we make decisions in life. If we want to be allies of different groups, I think it is important to recognize what is specifically helpful to them then providing those resources for them, like listening more to what they would like to see and hear. As communication is a two way street, always listening to what other people are passionate about so then they will listen to what you're passionate about.

I’m extremely grateful that Ken covered this part of the climate crisis. Being a communication major for whom science is not a strong suit, I found myself struggling to figure out how I could still play an impactful role in the climate crisis if I did not want to switch my major to Environment Studies. In fact, it doesn’t matter what major you have; there are still endless possibilities to take part in fighting climate change. 

               <br><br>

Many of the tips Ken had were helpful, including how to announce a change of your diet without coming across as an alarmist or shutting down conversations. But the reading was especially interesting to me. It seemed to blend the climate crisis with communication, which is almost exactly what I was looking for. I think the most valuable part of the reading was that when educating others about climate change you need to keep things short but make sure to repeat the message often so that it really sticks. It is also helpful when learning more about the climate crisis that the person detailing it is a credible person and that the speaker tailors their message to the audience, because climate change means something different to everyone. It is especially important to highlight the fact that climate change is not a distant problem, or one that we can brush off and come back to later. 

               <br><br>

So thank you, Ken, for covering all aspects of the climate crisis, including one that not only teaches us how to educate others on the subject, but also one that directly ties to my major. It gives me hope that, despite being humanities-focused, I can still take part in the climate crisis more than I previously imagined.

I guess being the opposite of that (a science major learning how to communicate to the general public aka my friends and family), I also found this reading assignment to be extremely helpful in ways that I would not be able to learn in a science class. 
               <br><br>

I personally think telling your narrative/story to people that are genuinely curious about your dietary choice (I wouldn't say restriction unless it's a real health issue) is far more effective than telling them how it could save the planet. I believe the reasonings are more important than the results. Kind of similar to that saying about how process is more beneficial to a person's growth than learning about the result. Even though I am not a big fan of repetition, but I find it as an extremely useful tool. I don't like reading the same thing but without reading the same thing it's not going to stick in my head. Also putting your objective in the first sentence/paragraph will greatly increase the likelihood of letting your audience understand your goal. I was surprised to learn about the fact that only one person in Congress has a PhD (I might be wrong, but something I read somewhere) which made me think how are they qualified to make decisions for us?! Even if they present factual information, how can I trust them with my future... my kid's future! 
               <br><br>

No matter what major you are, anyone can take part in shifting their daily actions to fight climate change. These small changes do not require you to understand the details of every aspect of climate change, but these small changes can definitely make a difference to climate change.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment here, Enya. I also am a communication major, and while I am also a geography major I find it hard to relate or feel as though I have the opportunity to play an impactful role as my emphasis is not in climate change. This reading was refreshing to me because I also felt as though I could relate to it much more thoroughly than other readings and films that have been assigned in this course. I think Ken's tips about not coming off as an alarmist were also very interesting and helpful because often times people just write off those that support the climate as they think they are crazy "save the planet or else we all die tomorrow" kinds of people. I also think the communication aspect of this reading was important and tied back to the concept of the younger generations needing to teach the older generations about the effects of climate change, something I find myself doing often as I update my parents frequently on new information I learn from this class.




<br><hr>

Hey, Enya, I can really relate to your feedback to this video. Spreading awareness and being courageous enough to make a change in your life is what this world needs. I am a Sociology major so that means I understand how people should work interconnectedly for the environment. As you mention, it is very important to learn how to tailor such an important message like this. Hence, I believe the most practical way of letting others know is by giving people the statistics because these are neither black or white. I have mentioned climate change among my friends in a way that allows them to understand the social injustice behind it; but also what we can do as humans to change this. Thus I like the way Ken delivers his messages in a non-alarmist way allowing viewers to grasp the array of problems our emissions can cause.

In this week's article“Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions,” I found that the strategies are crystal clear for us to understand. What makes this reading differ from previous is that this article teaches us how to communicate with others while talking about climate crisis. It informs us by supplying steps for us to become a skillful communicator. Moreover, as saying to be a vegan, I am probably not confident to do so because this is going to change my lifestyle completely. However, as claiming that I am a climatarian is way more realistic, since it gives me responsibility and hope to make changes to this world. I can cultivate many green habits and gradually affecting the people around me to join with me, more like the butterfly effect.

I completely agree that this reading did an excellent job on giving strategies to make more conversation about the climate crisis. Every movement starts with communication and the climate crisis is no exception. Before the readings I often saw it hard on how to begin a conversation about climate change. But the strategies giving in the reading really seem to give me confidence on being able to become an effective climate change advocate. Additionally, I didnt know what a climatarian was before this class. Unknowingly, I myself was a climatarian and i didn’t even know it. This reading will be useful as i know i can spark effective conversation on climate change and its importance.


<br><hr>
I love your comparison of communicating with those around you with the butterfly effect. By communicating effectively with those around you, you can exponentially increase the awareness of those around you regarding the climate crisis. In addition, those who you "convert" into being environmentally aware can do the same to their family and friends, continuing the spread of a more climate friendly community.  Not only does the butterfly effect symbolize the rapid spread of communication, it can also be a metaphor for a greener, more nature bound, like the butterfly. 
               <br><br>


I also agree with your stance of being a "climatarian" because while I am not vegan, I still am environmentally aware. I also find that, like this week's article suggests, communicating with others about being environmentally aware is one of the hardest challenges of climate activism. While it may seem easy to spew out information and statistics, this is not the right way to increase activism and awareness.  Often times, short, yet impactful messages are the ones that stick in people's mind. Just like how most famous quotes are short, concise, and meaningful, our messages about the importance of climate change should be the same. 
               <br><br>


In the video, Ken mentioned that he is often asked questions about his lifestyle being a minimalist and vegan among other things, yet he mainly keeps these traits to himself unless asked directly. While this ensures that one's audience is interested in the topic itself, I'm not sure if this method  entirely applies with the climate crisis. I feel like the people that ask about the state of the climate are those that are already aware of the problem, or at least open to the information and are willing to accept the facts and do something about it. On the other hand, there are those who can't accept climate change, the "Uncle Pete's", who deny that anything is happening. While some may be vocal about their positions, those who aren't likely don't care enough or are deniers, and if you don't communicate with them first, they won't be exposed to the new information.

I can definitely vouch for the “freegan” / ”climatarian” approach. I never liked calling myself vegan. I really like the way Ken put this feeling I’ve been having into words. I mentioned before how I would call myself “flexitarian” / “fegan”, now I have a new word to describe it! On another note, I am excited to put myself to the test and see if I can hold back from sharing too many things with the people around me in regards to this. I plan to focus more on improving myself and hoping it will show on its own. However, I do wonder one thing: What about the people who share their action on social media and other public platforms? Does this idea apply? I personally have been sharing videos, articles and everything else interesting on social media, but I don’t mention these things to friends and family as much. 
               <br><br>
Although it excites me to finally learn about climate communication, I am not sure I fully agree with the argument laid out regarding medical science. I have personally been exposed quite a bit to fabricated “facts” about what is truly healthy, and I do believe the United States in particular has much improvement to be made sooner rather than later. I believe there is simply a general growth in skepticism, what with all the fake news and information traveling around the Internet. Other than this little aspect of the reading, I enjoyed the optimism and straightforward-ness.

I also liked this new approach to describing unpopular climate conscious alternatives. More-so, I liked how Ken introduced some flexibility with the words, especially the concept of freeganism. Previously, I only associated it with dumpster diving, but the idea of applying it to food that would otherwise go to waste, such as the eggs that Pete rescued in the film, makes a lot of sense. 
               <br><br>


Personally, I have previously seen some of my friends and family avoid some foods at restaurants precisely because they were labeled as vegan. They avoid it as much as they do sugar-free items with a mentality of 'its vegan, its gotta taste bad'. Another thing I've found that works very well in fighting this stigma is providing counter example. For instance, I usually replied with pasta is vegan which has actually led in some cases to people trying new and delicious vegan options. One of my friends even picked the same vegan plate on her own when we returned to the restaurant a couple of weeks later.  

               <br><br>

Regarding the metaphor for medical science, I thought it was pretty good. Although it is true that there is a lot of misinformation out there especially surrounding vaccines and now the corona virus, the majority of the public is informed enough to trust  researchers and doctors with their health. Sure it is not perfect, but if the majority of patients trust their doctors it is exponentially better than no one in our current presidential administration trusting our climate scientists. Overall I think the analogy set up a nice parallell between the two and did well to outline the absurdness of refuting the facts and 97% of climate scientists.

I found the reading very informative and enjoyable at the same time. I like how the author gives 5 clear steps as to how we should go about conveying climate change to people. I really liked the story of Uncle Pete because it's so relatable and i know a lot of people like that in real life as well. I like how the author went in depth about the subject rather than just skimming over the details. I'm glad that we had this reading this week because now I feel like I have more preparation and ideas on how to go about communicating the climate change to my friends and family. I often want to talk about climate change with them and suggest ways to combat it, but don't really know how to go about that. This reading really helped explain how to do that in a logical and interesting way.

When I heard Ken introducing the character Uncle Pete in his video, I felt like he was going to be as he stated much like someone we knew in our own lives. Once I read that section, I found it to be quite true, Uncle Pete resembled many climate deniers. I too found the reading to be very insightful because it explained ways for us to communicate about the issue of climate change effectively. I felt like at times I was one of those people that spoke too much on the subject when asked about it simply because I wanted the person to know everything I knew, but then found out that probably wasn’t the best way to go about it because they tend to zone out on me. I need to understand that it’s too much information for one person to absorb at once, I learned all that I know over the course of eight weeks, not one day. The reading helped me open my eyes to that and shed light on how to better communicate it.


<br><Hr>
Hi Daphne, I feel the same way. I enjoyed this reading, and I think one of the main reasons I did was because it was overall just so easy to read and get through. It was very informative and I really liked the structure and the tips the author gave. I think the quote that stood out to me the most from this reading was when the author said, "For me, the best reason for communicating climate change science widely and accurately is that doing so can inform people and increase the likelihood that the world will act promptly, wisely, and forcefully." I strongly agreed with this quote, because I've made the lifestyle changes I have made so far because of what I was informed of. Like you, I also want to let my friends know more about climate change and am not sure how to get the right message across. As Ken mentioned in this video, sometimes I feel as if I can sound repetitive, even though I don't talk about the issues themselves all the time, but some of my eating habits often get brought up a lot. This video and the reading itself helped me find new ways to get the information across.

After reading the “Communicating Climate Change Science,” I realize the way we talk about the climate crisis to the public is wrong. We often give them a lot of statistics, examples, scientific terms to show the credibility to them. But one thing we forgot is, they maybe don’t understand these numbers, examples, or scientific terms. They maybe feel boring and don’t have interest to learn the solutions of climate crisis since it sounds complicated. The government who think climate crisis is a hoax just use a sentence to make some people believe: “The climate crisis is a hoax.” We think this sentence doesn’t have any credibility, but, for the public, they just use a few seconds to read the news, one sentence they can remember a lot compare to the statistics we give it to them. I think maybe we can change a way to spreads our idea that we need to take action to stop the climate crisis. We can use a more simple way, to emphasizing impacts of climate change happen now, to making connections between climate change and what people are experiencing in their daily lives, such as increases in extreme weather instead of trying to illustrate the complicated statistics to the public. We need to find a way to make the public rethink their relationship with nature, their duty to protect the planet, the future of their descendants. 
               <br><br>
According to the article, “the main barriers to action today are not technical or financial. They are a lack of widespread political will and a lack of wise and inspiring political leadership. Science can help to inform policy, but only concerned people and responsive, capable governments can decide what policies are best, and then implement them.” I believe more and more people will accept the science and concerned about global warming. And more people are willing to take action to make a better future for their descendants.

I agree that simplicity is key, especially in such a fast-paced culture like the U.S.'s. Even here on campus, people don't make time to stop and talk to an environmental activist for 5 minutes. It's frustrating that people don't want to listen but it's also true that the scientists and the people who hold information about the climate crisis go off about every issue we're facing. When I have conversations with people who aren't exactly passionate about saving the planet they get bored or annoyed because I talk about the issue very seriously and a lot of times I use scientific terms to sound more credible. After reading chapter 8 in "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" I realized I had been doing it all wrong. I'd always desperately try to get someone to take our climate crisis seriously by telling them everything I knew in the most formal way possible. Now I understand that we need to get creative with the way we spread information about this issue. 
               <br><br>


One of the strategies of getting people to take action when it comes to climate-related issues is talking about the solutions and the way people can help. I think up until now every conversation I've had about climate change has scared people more than it has motivated them. I tell people the things that could happen if we don't take action instead of telling them what actions to take instead. A lot of people are aware that the planet is in great danger but they're not inspired enough to do something about it and that is due to failure of communicating the issue properly. 

               <br><br>

For a long time I've shared with my friends that this issue is something that should be taught to present and future generations globally, if not nationally. The way we're going to get people to rethink their relationship with the planet and all that comes with it is by means of education; exposing people to this information everywhere, especially in grades K-12. Teachers have a tremendous impact on the values of kids and young adults. We need to raise generations that care about the planet and are aware of the impact their actions have. The same way we established national tests like the ACT and SAT, we need to establish a course that inspires the youth to live in a way that isn't destructive to the planet. I think if teachers applied the principles that this chapter suggested (using stories, metaphors, and appropriate language) we'd take a step forward in reconstructing our social norms and values.

This weeks reading was really interesting to me. I’m not going to lie, normally I find the readings really boring but I was really engaged with this one. In fact, my parents called me later on after I read this and we were talking politics (solely because my dad and I have different views) and I asked them what they thought about climate change. They of course had no idea about any of this and I was reading them excerpts from this reading. They were amazed and had no clue about any of it all besides “oceans were warming.” It is because this isn’t talked about enough and that’s why us younger generations need to be the ones to relay these messages to society who doesn’t know about them. Older generations are more than likely not looking up climate change on their free time. Back to the reading though, I think the approach on Uncles Pete’s statements were great. They really backed up the facts and proved that this is happening and it’s happening now.

It's so interesting that it really is up to us to communicate anything about climate change. Media really has failed us, hasn't it? Without our own institutions of news and spreading information, all we can do is talk to the people we know, use social media, build up a huge collective consciousness with younger people and those in our immediate circles but little to no one else. There is such a gigantic generational divide on climate change information, and I really, really hope that this video and reading can help us bridge the gap. But I keep thinking about how individual connections aren't enough. I can't stop worrying about it. How do we reach the mass of older people who don't have a politically-active grandchild; how do we reach everyone who only listens to the mainstream media that teaches nothing and informs less? This is good once we get the connection, when we're talking to someone personally, but I just can't stop worrying about what comes both before and after that. How do you make the connections with people outside of your family? I just don't know. I doubt it'll be enough, but every bit helps, huh? 
               <br><br>

Honestly, though, these resources are extremely valuable. Phrasing is everything. Connecting it to the right, non-alienating vocabulary is vital. As I'm reading your comment, I'm seeing that it's already helped people communicate better to the people they know, and I'm happy to see that. This is the right path.

I really enjoyed this week’s reading, because we finally were taking somewhat of a different approach on tackling the climate crisis. I feel like this reading, while it does cover facts, primarily focuses on finally distributing those facts to an audience. This audience may include a fictional character known as Uncle Pete, who doesn’t really believe in climate change. Uncle Pete resembles someone that a lot of people know. This reading is about communication and the various ways that we, climate activists, can communicate the issues of climate change to those that don’t believe in it, or at least to those that don’t understand it to its entirety. This reading discloses many strategies that not only climate scientists, but also young environmentalists such as ourselves, to communicate the issue to an audience from varying angles. 
                <br><br>
The first section of the reading was titled “Preparation”, which discussed, surprisingly enough, how to prepare for such a presentation on the issue. One thing that stuck to me which I really liked was that it discussed being straight forward in terms of facts, and that if you didn’t know something, such as the answer to a question, it’s totally fine; you’re not expected to know everything. The second section talked about another way of resonating the issue with the audience and that was through stories. This is another effective way to get the issue through to the audience. This section introduced the fictional character, Uncle Pete, who completely disagreed with the idea of climate change, and said that nothing needs to be done about it because it’s false and that liberals just want to take over the government, and etc. I found this quote very appealing that completely contradicted his ideology when talking about not doing anything about the situation: “Ironically, doing nothing at all about climate change, Uncle Pete’s preferred policy, is thus likely to force governments to do exactly what Uncle Pete fears most: seize power and limit freedoms.” The third section, which I really enjoyed, introduced the idea of metaphors as another form of persuasion. They gave an example of one of these metaphors which stuck to me immediately. This was just such a perfect metaphor, which made so much sense that there’s no way that even the most dim witted human on the planet could not comprehend the amount of logical sense it made. I have to quote the entire thing, because it resonated with me so much, that I hope it does the same for you. Here it is: “Imagine you are watching a major- league professional baseball game. The slugger who is thought to be on performance-enhancing drugs hits a home run. Did the steroids cause it? Wrong question. You can’t be sure they caused it, because he was already a big-league slugger when he was clean. And even with the drugs, he can still strike out now and then. But at the end of the season, you see in his statistics that he hit more homers than he used to. The drugs increase the odds of home runs. If baseball does not interest you, other sports can be equally effective vehicles for this metaphor. A bicycle racer on illegal drugs does not win every race, but his chances of winning are increased. Climate is the statistics of weather, and CO2 is the steroids of climate.” Could not have said it better myself. It really gave me a better understanding of how climate change works and why some people just don’t understand it, which is why I really enjoyed this section on metaphors. 
               <br><br>
 The fourth section really emphasized on the reason why most people, such as climate scientists, just aren’t able to get the public to understand the severity of climate change. It discussed the topic of language and how it should be projected to an audience, especially one that doesn’t play a huge role in the scientific community. In the reading, it discussed the issue that, “Scientists in any specialty tend to speak to one another in a strange and private language that seems bizarre to non scientists or even to scientists in other specialties.” This is one of the main problems climate scientists encounter when trying to communicate the issue with an audience that doesn’t have a deeper understanding of the subject matter. A tip given in this section for climate scientists or any environmental influencer is to avoid words that are unfamiliar to the wider world. I agree with this tip, because I’ve been on the other side of this problem. There have been times where someone would try to explain to me something that they’re passionate about or believe in greatly, but just couldn’t get the point across completely, because I didn’t know about half the things they were saying, which made the conversion pointless. They would’ve been more effective if they explained in more simple turns, or at least in a way that I, the average college student, would understand it. I definitely find it more impressive when someone can explain something complex in simple terms, as opposed to someone that complicates things and explains something simple in a complex way. If they manage to explain it in simple terms, it makes me believe more and more in their credibility and understanding of the material. As the genius Albert Einstein once said, “If you can’t explain it to a six yeat old, you don’t understand it yourself.” The author stated that they “...urge every climate science communicator to messages that are simple and memorable…”, which is a good tip for those that struggle in the field of communication. 
               <br><br>
 And finally, onto the last and probably one of the most important sections of this chapter, “Solutions”. A strong argument made in this section was that “Nobody wants to hear about hopelessness…”, which is why this section was made; to give the reader and the audience hope. What I love about this section is that it brings up the importance of the role that politics and government play in the climate crisis. It discusses how the barriers we must overcome aren’t technical or financial, but political. As stated in the section, we have the technology to make change, but lack the political will to do so. This resonated a lot with me, because even though there are a lot of other aspects that contribute to resolving the issue of climate change, I find the political aspect to be the most important, because of the amount of power it has and the because of the impact it can have on a society in an instant, whether it be for better or worse. That’s why our generation has to vote for the candidates that they believe will have the most beneficial impact for their country. Another main barrier that most politicians have to surpass is accepting the science, because, “Your policies and values and politics have a role to play in deciding which actions are best, but any rational policy begins by accepting the science.” It’s a good thing that some politicians, such as Bernie Sanders, have overcome such a barrier for the sake of our planet. I have faith in our generation that we will make the right choices for candidates in this upcoming election, not just for the greater good, but for the sake of this planet we call “home”.

I totally agree with your comments. A lot of the readings we have been assigned have been smoky littered with facts and statistics. They provide scientific details that can be a bit tricky to truly grasp. On the contrary,. i thought the author did a really good job using different metaphors to communicate his message. The first one, Uncle Pete, a character I think almost anyone can relate to. Everyone has that "know it all" in their lives who no matter the topic, believe they are always right. It can be infuriating to deal with them, just as it is to deal with climate deniers. As a baseball enthusiast, the steroid analogy used really resonated with me. While I had never thought about it like that, the comparison is spot on. It seems especially prevalent with the recent cheating scandal rocking the baseball world right now. Finally, i totally agree with the point made about scientists speaking in their own dialect that is hard to understand for regular people. If more of these issues can be simplified, I believe more people will understand and care about them.

I totally agree with your comments. A lot of the readings we have been assigned have been smoky littered with facts and statistics. They provide scientific details that can be a bit tricky to truly grasp. On the contrary,. i thought the author did a really good job using different metaphors to communicate his message. The first one, Uncle Pete, a character I think almost anyone can relate to. Everyone has that "know it all" in their lives who no matter the topic, believe they are always right. It can be infuriating to deal with them, just as it is to deal with climate deniers. As a baseball enthusiast, the steroid analogy used really resonated with me. While I had never thought about it like that, the comparison is spot on. It seems especially prevalent with the recent cheating scandal rocking the baseball world right now. Finally, i totally agree with the point made about scientists speaking in their own dialect that is hard to understand for regular people. If more of these issues can be simplified, I believe more people will understand and care about them.

I thought this reading was valuable and very different from other assignments we have had thus far. It is really important that people believe in anthropogenic climate change in order for a change to be made. Communication is obviously key in spreading information, especially to skeptics. The methods discussed were interesting to hear, and helped me learn what kind of speech to employ and hold back from using.

               <br><br>

Climate change is not necessarily an easy topic to understand, especially with it having become a political issue, when it really should not be. Effective communication is key to actually helping people understand the complex issue and hopefully change their mind or even have them become an activist themselves. One of the most useful communication methods to me was to not use "fancy" complex words, but rather to use words that are easy enough to understand to get the basic point across. If people start talking about the deep statistics or chemical and biological problems etc... people will tune out and not want to listen anymore. It is important to understand the audience and speak appropriately. 

               <br><br>

Lastly, the part about hopelessness hit home for me, because I am pretty pessimistic about the outcome of the climate crisis. I think our best bet is for politicians to make policy changes to reduce emissions. This was talked about in part of the reading and did give me a little bit more hope.

After watching this video and reading the assignment, I learned how communication is a very important aspect in terms of sending the message about protecting the environment. People learn about certain issues in different forms of communication. And from the video I learned that Ken's form of communication is very effective and respectful towards individuals who are less informed in regards to solutions for protecting the environment. He mentioned that he prefers to wait and respect the other person he is addressing until they can come into terms with Ken's agenda so that they can understand in a deeper level. This form of communication should be utilized when communicating with other people about climate issues because there are many opinions (differing and agreeing) about this problem. And some individuals may not agree with one another. Communication is key when showing your agenda and hoping to gain support and understanding about your own opinion. I hope that people in the future can adapt this form of communication so that society will be in harmony more about climate issues.

It is most definitely our generations duty to speak out and inform everyone. Part of me, I'll admit, is frustrated that it's been left to us, but another part of me accepts it and takes on the responsibility. I, like you, have experienced similar issues when trying to convince people of the realness, severity, or solutions to climate change. I think the most important piece of advice this reading puts forward is to listen to the other person, to address their fears and concerns. Because that's what's blocking the actual information - fear. That's what we need to dismantle.
               <br><br>

Sitting down with people and first listening to them will build your credibility as someone who shares the same goals, desires, and fears as them – we are after all all humans trying to figure this world out. I may be generalizing a tad here, but the most common and sanest objection I hear to environmental action is related to the economy. I then take this objection as an opportunity to assure people that I’m concerned with people’s livelihoods too. We, after all, still need ways to provide for ourselves and finding a way to do that in harmony with the environment is crucial.

I resonate very heavily with what Ken talked about in the video. I’ve been vegetarian for 7 years but have always tried to be respectful of people’s choices and have tried to never impose my lifestyle on anyone. I’m never the one to bring up the subject of vegetarianism, but rather let whoever I'm with ask me. If someone offers me a piece of meat, I’m never rude or say anything along the lines of “Ew no that’s gross”. Instead, I just say I don’t eat meat. That will usually get people to ask questions, and they are often very curious and willing to talk about it. The question I get asked most frequently is “What made you go vegetarian?”, which I love, because it allows me to give them movie recommendations, and also just opens up the topic of the climate crisis in general. I find it so annoying when people try to convince others that their lifestyle is better than someone else's. As Ken mentioned, trying to do so definitely makes people completely shut down the idea of ever even considering trying something new out. People make efforts at different rates and in different ways. I think communication is such a key part of getting people on board. It’s a really touchy subject because if you overwhelm someone even slightly, they will automatically shut off and will oppose whatever it is you’re trying to convince them of. I like how the reading phrased how to successfully communicate: “Here in 12 words is the guiding philosophy that underlies our approach to climate science communication: Use simple clear messages, repeated often, by a variety of trusted messengers”. I feel like a great example of this is the Green New Deal, which does exactly so. It is written clearly so that normal folks can understand it, by reliable sources. In general though, taking that approach is critical in terms of relaying information about the climate crisis.

I really respect what you have said about choosing vegetarianism but not imposing it upon others. This is a skill of communication that many young people like us should learn - not shoving one's opinions or lifestyle choices in someone else's face, even if they are in fact laudable decisions, but calmly and respectfully promoting it to those who might be interested. Same with climate change: to actually make a significant difference, it is more important to obtain some kind of consensus with people outside one's sphere of influence, because those who agree with you will usually contribute less to the problem than those who, for instance, think of climate change as a hoax manufactured by Democrats to score political points. 
               <br><br>

I have to say that communication is not that straightforward - it's also not the most taught subject on a university campus. I've definitely overwhelmed a few people in my past, but I believe that as I try to gain more knowledge and learn from the mistakes in past conversations, I will have more success in becoming a more effective speaker. For example, I've managed to convince quite a few to reduce their food waste and only take what they really need, which is a nice step to begin with!

I found the tone of this week's reading, “Communicating Climate Change Science” to be subtly condescending. The use of a metaphorical "Uncle Pete" as placeholder for those who don't believe in climate change would have been a smart persuasion tactic had they not employed it so mockingly. "When Uncle Pete comes to dinner, he ruins the meal for everyone else by loudly proclaiming that climate scientists are dishonest..." While I am a firm believer in anthropogenic climate change, I also know that not all individuals who reject climate change are obnoxious, incompetent idiots like this chapter portrays them as. That said, I did enjoy several of the points made, such as the parallel to the intense effects temperature can have internally on our bodies when it rises by a couple degrees and the fact that not acting is making a choice. The points explaining anthropogenic climate change were clever and well articulated, however, the points refuting opposing beliefs could have been less patronizing and inane.

I definitely think you bring up some really good points in saying that the author loses some credibility when he portrays "Uncle Pete" as obnoxious and blatantly annoying. Any climate change denier that reads that report is going to feel like they're being attacked and only double down on their opinions-the opposite of the intended outcome. I feel as though the metaphor of an "Uncle Pete" could have been more useful if he wasn't made into such a caricature of a human. The author claims that all Uncle Pete's believe this or that, but such a narrow-minded approach negates any ability for Uncle Pete to explain himself, where a climate scientist would have more information about where Pete was coming from, and be able to explain the science without condescending.
               <br><br>


As far as communicating with friends and family that don't know where to start their journey towards reducing their carbon footprint, I feel like an important start would be the statistics in our daily lives. If we could all cut transportation drastically (for example: fly less, take more public transport) then we would make a huge difference on the climate. Personally, I think the next important thing to change would be diet because although it is less impactful than housing, I think it's also a more doable change in a first world country with access to all kinds of foods.
<br><hr>

I agree that the "Uncle Pete" analogy is ineffective. In addition to offending climate deniers into being extra defensive, and thereby unwilling to be susceptible to any other arguments that would sway them to the other side, the Uncle Pete figure is fails to acknowledge the most dangerous kind of climate deniers. There are deniers out there who are well spoken and well educated, and thus this makes them even more influential and persuasive than Uncle Petes, whose obnoxiousness only turns people away from their perspectives.  Such deniers could be organizations like the Heartland Institute who meticulously targets the most vulnerable audiences and uses well-argued points to convince them that anthropogenic climate change isn't real. Usually, climate deniers like the Heartland Institute are deniers for their own personal gain, usually monetary. They are more dangerous than Uncle Pete because they are the people who create climate deniers like Uncle Pete.



<br><hr>

I agree with your point about the use of the "Uncle Pete" character. While it is important to recognize that we may all have a human-made climate change denier in our lives, the way that the author portrays this person is not completely appropriate. Like you mention, not all climate change deniers are aggressive and stupid. However, other than that, I do believe that this chapter was a very important read. It was interesting to see how Somerville broke down various methods of communication. The idea of removing jargon from the conversation and converting measurements to non-metric numbers are two pretty simple things that can be changed about how climate crisis information is spoken about. Large scientific words or numbers can often cause people to turn away from the important information being communicated. 
               <br><br>

Also, like Ken mentioned, it's important to communicate about veganism or vegetarianism in a less explosive way. The idea of climatarianism is a really good way to speak about agriculture's effect on the environment without projecting the negative stereotypes of those who eat a mostly plant based diet. Like the turkey burger example, it's not only better for your physical health, but it's 2.5 times better for the environment than a beef burger. Like many of the examples in both this video and the reading, the key to communicating about the climate crisis is to, essentially, soften the blow -- don't be aggressive with statistics and big words and don't preach about a "radical" diet if your audience won't be immediately receptive.

While reading this the first story stood out to me and I related to it greatly. During this past Christmas one of my Uncles said to me “Jayce you need to take Geology classes, because that will show you that climate change isn't real and what is going on today is just a geological cycle that has happened in the past, like with the Ice Age.” When this comment was said to me, I was taken aback, and while reading this chapter is brought to my attention that a lot of people think like this, and a lot of them are not uneducated individuals. Like my Uncle who believes this hoax went to both UC Berkeley, and Cal Poly, majoring in engineering and is now an architect, and was also valedictorian of his graduating class. Reading this and also relating to it in my own life makes me very pessimistic, because I cannot wrap my head around the fact that people, and even people very close to me, actually deny the black and white facts of climate change, it blows my mind. 
               <br><br>

This chapter, though, gave the audience very useful tips to use when trying to communicate climate change to others, that I will use in the future. From stories, to metaphors, to the language one uses, are all effective ways to educate and communicate climate change to others. I found this very beneficial, especially for people like me who come from small, rural towns, full of conserative thinkers. I will most definitely bring these tips and tools into my own life when educating the people within my life. As advocates for the climate we need to use our voices, communicate, and educate others on climate change problems, and solutions.

I relate to your story, as I too have family who doesn’t believe in the severity of climate change. They often brush it off when I bring it up and when they do acknowledge it, they say that all the solutions are unrealistic. I share your frustration, as my family members have college educations and are leaders in their professional fields. While I try to sway them with facts and solutions, it often doesn’t work. When I first started reading the chapter, I was excited to learn about new ways to discuss climate change. Changing the rhetoric and language I use is definitely a good start, and I now know how to rebut their myths. Climate change can seem complex and confusing, often allowing people to get away with believing and spreading myths. 
               <br><br>
Now that I have scientific data to back up my belief, it is easier to demonstrate that climate change deniers are wrong. I found this reading to be very applicable to real life.


<br><hr>
Totally get what you mean. Despite having learned so much about climate change over the last 1-2 years, I sometimes find it difficult to explain to others who are convinced it is a hoax or exaggerated. This week’s reading, as well as Ken’s video has helped me look at some helpful strategies on how to communicate with those who do not believe it. Preparation, for me, is a key aspect of how to better help others understand. The more knowledgeable you are of the subject, the more convincing you can be.




<br><hr>
I definitely agree with your comment post, I guess the saying that, 'Old dogs never learn new tricks' could be referred to this issue. I find it mind-blowing that there are people out there who doesn't believe that climate change is real. Especially, when it is your own relatives who has that perspective. I usually think that we as students have a role to educate our parents and our relatives regarding this issue. However,  they often neglect our opinions due to the fact that we are inexperienced and young. In addition, they often cling to their past generation beliefs because they pride themselves on 'surviving' calamities in their era.  They see climate change as a hoax or a natural cycle of Earth, which is very unfortunate to know that they have a limited mindset.

Most of my family lives in a small town near Merced, California and I as well know an Uncle Pete. Growing up, my parents have always done a great job in raising me to be environmentally friendly and educated about the climate crisis. We used to recycle, compost, and grow our own fruits and vegetables. However, my uncle Mike would call us tree huggers and libtards. As you may have guessed, he is a conservative republican who doesn’t believe in climate change and has no sympathy for anyone but himself. He also went to college for engineering and naturally excels in mathematics. It is shocking to come to the understanding that there are people who major in STEM courses and still continue to not understand or deny  the climate crisis. The most common misconception that I have heard was that it is just the weather. Sometimes it is difficult to debate with my conservative family when they have such different views. It’s also awkward sometimes because no one wants to be the one to start an argument about politics at the thanksgiving table.  However, the chapter on “Communicating Climate Change Science” helped me think of ways to help educate and have a respectful conversation with my conservative family. 
               <br><br>

This chapter helped not only with simplifying the facts, but with helping communicate climate science. I thought it was interesting how Ken mentioned the judgement towards Veganism and Vegetarianism. It amazes me how many people are against green Monday and complain about how DLG will not have any meat products (even though green Monday is only like once a month). The amount of judgement I receive from even being pescatarian amazes me. Vegans are often labeled as annoying or judgmental, which, although some are, is an overgeneralization. I’m glad that Ken addressed this because it just shows how we can better specify what exactly our diet is, and spark an important conversation in the process.

The video and reading give very good points on how communication is key and is more of a social skill compared to the hard scientific facts that the research is about. What comes to mind is even when refraining from using scientific jargon in research papers, terms scientists use can sometimes have different meanings in normal conversations. Phrases such as a positive feedback loop and manipulation carry vastly different meanings than what scientists intend. Another thing is how that scientific papers are completely opposite from media writing which captures attention. I believe this is a major reason that climate change doubters have gained a large following in the US when the research has already been released to the public. Sadly, even though research is and has been already been around, spreading the word to the public is the next step in order to help the Earth. Effective communication tools must be utilized to both inform those who do not know, and change the minds of doubters who have been misinformed. 
               <br><br>
But since I am not a scientist, I do not think I will be able to use any of the advice given in the reading but it still gave good insight on the situation. This video however talked about things that are more applicable to am average person's life. I was really surprised that changing from beef to other meats will have such a big impact and is far more likely than having everyone be vegan or vegetarian. I also like how realistic Ken is when talking about change and how it is very unlikely that everyone can fully cut out beef even though that is what would be best for the environment.

I think something like this is especially useful for college students like us who are now learning the reality of anthropogenic climate change. My whole life I had heard of global warming, but it never seemed like something that would cause a direct impact on my life. Taking this class has allowed me to realize that nothing could be farther from the truth. Anthropogenic climate change has been predicted since the 1850s but because its effects are subtle most people remained ignorant. Generations of the past knew, didn’t care, and now are at fault for keeping the same systems in place. As if I don’t have enough to worry about getting a degree and putting myself in a position to have a successful career. It's saddening to think about the future like I really wonder if I’m going to live old enough to have a family. Now my generation is responsible for communicating the climate crisis and taking action to invoke change. Whether I want the responsibility or not it's been thrust upon the youth at large. I’m glad I had the opportunity to read this chapter of “Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions” as it does a good job of explaining the most effective way to inform others of the current climate situation. I was at church talking to an Uncle Pete type character, and I have to admit that being prepared is the most essential part of communicating about climate change. He claimed that the Earth goes through natural cycles of warming which he probably heard watching PragerU or something, but I quickly responded with the fact that we are now going under the 6th mass extinction, losing hundreds of species a day, which is a direct result of the massive amount of CO2 that’s been released through transportation production and the agricultural industry. I went on to explain how the U.S. is responsible for ¼ of carbon emissions and I broke down all the environmental impacts that will be felt with a global temperature rise of 2*C. I ended with asking him to not be so easily influenced by climate deniers as we, the youth, are going to have to invoke the change necessary.

I really enjoyed this reading and the way it put information out there. I agreed with the beginning statement that the more you talk the less people want to hear from you. When you start involving too many numbers and statistics people start to get bored, so instead of just stating what's happening but not giving the exact numbers will help a person listen. And just like Ken said, when they ask more questions that’s when you can start listing what you know, but people are only interested when they feel like they want to be taught, not when they’re forced to be taught. The only problem with this is there are a lot of Uncle Pete’s who don’t want to be taught. It’s hard to communicate with these people because they feel like they already know everything and no matter what you say, you’re wrong. Personally, I feel like these people aren’t worth the fight because you could be spending time on others willing to learn.
               <br><br>


I really liked that the author knew that changing wouldn’t be easy. He compared it to cigarette smoking and that it wouldn’t be easy to quit. It made me like this more because he’s being realistic about the future and he knows we won’t be able to get through this problem. I feel like this almost contradicts what Ken says about it being so easy to just make the simple changes we need to save the world. We’re so dependent on all these items and it’s unrealistic to believe we’ll be able to quit cold turkey. If we can make the change, it’ll most likely be a slow development of changes.

I agree, it's hard to capture someone's attention without making it seem like something that's personally impactful to them. It's important to know what people are interested in, because almost all of our activities cause warming. People who love shopping, for example, should be outraged by the way companies betray the trust of both workers and shoppers by forcing unstable working conditions. I know I don't want any part in the torture of people in third world countries, and it makes me think more critically about the way I shop. I love clothes, but thrift stores are such a fun hunt and find. Plus, since I have had shopping marketed to me relentlessly since I was a little girl as an appropriate activity for women, I feel a deep social obligation to the girls who unwillingly become complacent in the worldwide suffering of people, most commonly women.
               <br><br>
I think the changes need to happen now, but I do appreciate the metaphor about cigarette smoking. This situation reminds me of the vaping crisis that happened, when hundreds of teenagers addicted to e-cigs started getting sick. We didn't know much about them before this had started, and we still don't. They assumed some long-term effects would come, but didn't know the severity of damage they were causing to their bodies. Once they learned the news, they had to quit quickly or risk a near death hospital visit. We need to make the switch like that.

Unlike many of the other readings that we have done so far in class, “Communicating Climate Change Science” helped explain exactly how we are to go forward in raising awareness for the climate crisis.  I really enjoyed how the journal was strategically organized into a step-by-step guide about how to communicate the facts of the climate crisis.  Before reading this, I had no idea how to confront climate change deniers if I had ever come across one.  I never suspected to come across a climate change denier because of the fact that I live in California where a majority of people believe in climate change.  However, I am glad to know that if I ever came across someone who shared different views than me about the climate crisis, I would be able to efficiently communicate to them the proven facts of our warming planet.  I really enjoyed how the journal personified climate change deniers into one “Uncle Pete” type of person.  Doing this helped me really visualize a situation in which I would be prompted to communicate my views to a climate change denier.  I never really realized how important effective communication is especially in talking about the climate crisis.  However, because of the urgency of this issue, I know that effectively communicating the climate crisis to someone is important in order for the likelihood of people to act promptly to increase. 

               <br><br>

 Another aspect of the video that I found very interesting was Ken’s commentary on climatarians and freegans.  Prior to watching the video, I had no idea that being a climatarian was a real thing.  Being a vegetarian myself, I am always trying to improve the way I eat in order to be more environmentally conscious.  I feel that being a climatarian gives you a certain flexibility that bases itself on the principle of eating with the climate instead of restricting yourself from one entire food group.  I think even if you are a vegetarian or a vegan, you are able to also be a climatarian in the ways that you maintain a sort of environmental consciousness while still abstaining from animal products.  This adds a new level to environmental consciousness that I can be mindful of in my everyday life.

I also agree with you. I think this week's reading is very interesting. It's not the same as the previous reading. It makes us better understand in a vivid and vivid way. What's more, how can we effectively improve others' understanding of the serious problem of climate change? What's more, I also like to compare this climate environment to an unclean person , it may have an impact on us. Ken's video really gives me a lot of new ideas, such as how to improve their understanding of the serious problem of climate change through communication with others, how to make them interested in understanding the problem, such as if you were in a restaurant and your friends asked if you had any taboos against food, I would not say that I was a vegetarian, I should talk to them I used to be a vegetarian, but now I am a liberal, so they will be interested in continuing to ask, rather than finishing the dialogue immediately. I think this statement is really helpful for communication and problem-solving. Although I'm not a vegetarian myself, such an example can help me get inspiration in other aspects, such as how to say it so that others don't want to interrupt the conversation immediately, but continue to ask.

Hey Meredith, I completely agree with you ! This is the text I needed to read without knowing it . It is the perfect tool not only for us to inform others about what we have learned in class, but for those who wish to advocate for the climate crisis and seek to become environmental activists. At the beginning of the chapter,  the author gives us 12 facts about climate change and it was sad to be reminded that the amount of CO2 now is the highest that it has ever been in a million years! The generations behind us are the ones that have done the most damage to our planet. Hence it is our job now to use our voice to act, thus this chapter provides us with strategies that we surely need to educate others about the climate crisis and how to best approach others. As mentioned in the text, we must understand where skeptics of climate change come from. Also, I would like to note that while the data in this text was retrieved in 2018, the author says “we’re already about halfway to that allowed amount of atmospheric CO2”, consequently, in only two years since 2018 the Earth has warmed 1.8 degrees—almost reached the 2 degree Paris agreement in 2015.
               <br><br>
Furthermore, the author suggests the use of metaphors as a method to achieve a better understanding of a topic and make it easier to remember for people. I think the thermostat metaphor and the planetary fever metaphor are very appealing to the audience and made me think twice about how true it is that we literally have control of our planet. We have come to the point where there’s so many of us that we forget that we all share the same home and whatever we do affects others.
                <br><br>

Similarly, I, too, found the concept climatarian very interesting. Before watching Ken's video I had never heard about it and as he notes, "it can be the bridge to vegetarianism". It does seem like a more flexible diet that allows you to choose to be more conscious of your carbon footprint and how to lower it.

I completely agree with your comment. I loved how the reading for this week, “Communicating Climate Change Science,” provided us with a direct outline, like you said, about what to do when confronted with climate change deniers. I really appreciate when Ken presents us with material that gives us a clear idea of how to act in the face of the climate crisis. While I have never been confronted by a climate change denier, I have had some discussions with friends who do not want to believe that the beef industry is one of the main causes of climate change. These discussions have always been difficult because it seems like they always result in an argument of some sort. Arguments obviously are not productive and will do no good in convincing people to eat less meat. I was fascinated about Ken’s comment to let people come to you about your lifestyle choices. This is a brilliant idea because it is much less likely to produce an argument. After all, why would someone want to disagree with you when they are simply asking questions about your life? I also like the objectivity of this idea. When people ask you questions about your lifestyle choices, your responses will be fairly straightforward. You will simply be answering their questions with the factual truth about your life. There will be no angle of you trying to convince them to do something. If they choose to follow your lifestyle choices it will be them making their own personal choice. I have also experienced being on the other end of people trying to convince me of a certain lifestyle choice. I admit that even if I agree with where they’re coming from, it’s incredibly annoying to have their message forced at you without you asking. I’m sure this is a big reason as to why so many people mock vegans. It’s not the message that is being ridiculed but the delivery of that message.

Fortunately, I also have never come across a climate change denier as someone who has lived California her whole life. I honestly would not know how to convince them otherwise, so I do appreciate this reading. Now, if I ever do encounter a climate change denier, I would know how to communicate and approach the topic. One of the reasons why I would not know what to say is because as a non-stem major, I don’t know how to clearly explain the facts of the climate crisis. Thus, I enjoyed how the journal was organized in a  step-by-step guide as well, and I like how it’s not only factual but sympathetic. The sections I liked the most were stories and metaphors, which is something I use to explain things to people on a real life basis. I feel by using those two ways you make the problem more relatable and empathetic. I also think it makes what you’re saying harder to deny if you compare it to something outside of global warming. 
               <br><br>
I honestly never knew climaterans and freeganism is a way of eating. I didn’t realize it, but I have been eating like a climaterian. Ever since taking this class, I abstain from buying meat products while grocery shopping. Also, when I go out to eat, I look at all the options and generally choose options that are more plant-based.

I concur with your sentiments regarding the excerpt from the book on “Communicating Climate Change Science." Communication and persuasion have never really been my forte in life. I'd much rather take an aggressive or spiteful angle when placed in a situation with someone similar to an Uncle Pete figure. Therefore, the communication tactics visualized within the chapter were interesting, yet very much outside of my comfort zone. I'm not sure how well I'd actually be able to implement any of the skills. The effectiveness of these types of educational material vary from person-to-person. I would definitely have trouble applying skills that emphasize the implementation of metaphors or stories. However, I can see the importance of promoting these communication tactics as in order for the world to fight back against the climate crisis, everyone has to work together and accept that the crisis is real and that it is here, now. 

               <br><br>


In regard to the intro video, the climatarian/freegan values spoken about by Ken have been something that I've been trying to apply personally for a while now, cutting beef entirely out of my diet. The application of an environmental consciousness towards your food choices appeals much better than other arguments on diets that focus on ethics in my opinion.

I grew up in a household where the pantry was always stocked with chips and cookies and anything processed under the sun. My fridge holds processed meats and cheese and certainly not enough vegetables. Before coming to college, I didn’t think twice about this. I felt that it was normal to go the grocery store and grab whatever I wanted without any thought. As i have grown and seen the habits of those around me, I have shifted my understanding of what it means to fuel myself and what it means when I don’t give thought to my eating habits. I feel as though I was eating selfishly for most of my life; I have now come to recognize my part in the impact mass production has on the environment. I don’t know if going fully green is feasible for me. I still have a harder time eating veggies over meat, or alternatives to dairy. But slowly I have come to understand that not thinking is unacceptable. It would be impossible to ask everyone in the United States to change their eating habits. Culture is a huge factor when it comes to eating. Jewish culture (that I share in) places emphasis on meat. This has been a hard truth for me to swallow. As I have invested in understanding my impact on the planet, I have realized that an adjustment isn’t a necessary inconvenience. And I hope more people come to understand this on their own time. I have begun to switch my purchases to organic and I already feel a change in my personal sense of wellbeing. I believe this is fostering a deeper respect for the planet in me as well.

I am very thankful that Ken assigned this reading for this week and this particular chapter as communicating to other about the climate crisis is something I often have trouble doing in a productive and non-annoying way. That is why when Ken assigned us to read “Why Scientists Disagree about Climate Change,” I was not at all confused why he assigned it because to me, it gave me the very thing I needed: I needed to know the other side of this argument about climate change in order to have a conversation with people who don’t believe in the climate crisis. As one step in chapter 8 suggested, “Preparing well is the first step to communicating well.” I feel that knowing the other side of the argument helps me better prepare myself for the time the conversation comes because knowing the other side’s concerns can only help me explain my side of things even better…if that makes sense. 
                <br><br>
Another part of this chapter I found helpful was 8.4 where the warning against using empty jargon is evident. As an English major, I know this to be very true and the dangers of using jargon. It is so important to avoid using language that may confuse your readers; I find a lot of empty jargon often used in scientific articles about the climate crisis which turns me off from the idea of actually reading it. I think this is the point though. I think a lot of climate deniers use language they know the average person won’t understand as a way to keep us on the outside and engrave even more misunderstandings about the science of it all. But I’ve noticed writings about why the climate crisis is real are always straight-forward and invite not just type of audience member, but is open to the general ordinary person like myself.

Hey Hannah! I strongly agree with your point that you must first know about the other side of an argument in order to truly address the concerns of that side. While I too was a bit confused when Ken assigned "Why Scientists Disagree about Climate Change," I found that after reading it I had a much better understanding of the beliefs and ideas of those who deny climate change, and consequently had a much easier time refuting and countering their usual talking points. This idea of learning about the other side is mentioned in the reading as well, when the author states that "you can and should learn the most common myths and falsehoods about the science." I think that this aspect of climate change communication is often overlooked, and I am glad that the reading emphasized it as an important step in effective communication.

               <br><br>

In addition, I too found the warning against using empty jargon helpful, as all too often I see people with good intentions not being heard due to their use of technical or scientific terms that only serve to turn their audience off of their ideas. I think that the reading expressed this sentiment well in stating one should "match the language that you use to the audience you want to reach." To me, this is the perfect approach to communicating ideas about climate change effectively, because it comes with the understanding that we are not all starting at the same place regarding our knowledge of climate change or the scientific lingo surrounding it, and thus there needs to be separate ways in which the ideas of climate change our communicated to us. For example, while it would be wildly ineffective for me to try and explain the idea of ocean acidification to my 8 year old neighbor using terms like  "surface ocean pH" and "carbonate ion concentration," telling him that the oceans are becoming more acidic because they are absorbing CO2 being emitted by humans would almost certainly give him a better understanding of the topic. Overall, I think we simply need to consider who we are talking to when speaking about climate change, and our communication of it will be much more effective.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with how helpful this introduction video was in addition to the assigned reading for this week. Ken's personal experience with trying to help people move to take action who already believe in climate change in addition to the reading's explanation of different tactics to use to help explain the climate change crisis to people who are in denial of the science and validity of this problem. What I took away most from Ken's video was to not give the full explanation of what needs to be done to eliminate a majority of our own emissions but to instead build a metaphorical bridge that someone can relate to and begin taking steps toward living a more sustainable life. Ken explains how explaining veganism right away may put others off switching directly to a plant-based diet while explaining libertarianism or a freegan diet provides a middle ground or bridge to acting in a more sustainable and earth friendly way. Once people are already climatarians or freegans it is much easier to transfer from here to becoming a vegan than straight from consuming large amounts of meat and dairy to cutting these foods out immediately. The part I found most helpful from the reading was the section about language within the chapter of communicating climate change science. In this section the writer explained how "scientists in any specialty tend to speak to one another in a strange and private language that seems bizarre to nonscientists or even to scientists in other specialties." Because of this the solution is to make sure you explain science in the units and language that are familiar to your audience and compose messages that are simple and will be memorable to who you're talking to. They provided a table that explained some words that are common to be used by scientists and after seeing how these words could be interpreted by the public in contrast to what they actually mean I saw how important it is to use familiar language to your audience. Knowing this along with the other points from the chapter about preparation, metaphors, and including solutions have prepared me better to explain the problem of climate change to those who may not completely explain the issue.

Uncle Pete did remind me of someone in my real life and that person is my uncle. My uncle does not believe that climate change is real and he thinks it is a hoax. When I showed him the Green New Deal, he shot it down immediately and called it unrealistic. I tried to show him a couple of the films that were assigned to us but he refused to watch them also. In my opinion, I don't think talking to those who doubt climate change no matter what will help so I try to focus my energy elsewhere. I'd also like to mention my uncle is an avid Trump supporter so that does not help. In my opinion, President Trump needs to improve his way of taking care of the climate crisis instead of denying it outright. The fact that the leader of the greatest nation in the world is denying climate change is truly disheartening and dangerous because many others can develop that mindset and think the same. Hopefully a president that is also worried about the state of our planet’s climate gets elected in 2020. I read a fellow student's comment that caught my attention and it said, "despite our good intentions, more often than not, the people who actively deny or remain skeptical about climate change and our contribution to it, are not often going to listen to a fact heavy and overwhelming lecture on climate change that may directly challenge one or more of the freedoms and liberties that the “Uncle Petes” of the world hold dear. While it makes sense to wait for our own Uncle Petes to come to us to ask questions, this poses a concern that I just can’t seem to easily resolve: With critical deadlines to enact change a major presidential election just days away, how can we possibly wait patiently in hopes that they will suddenly take an active interest in the climate and our relationship with it?" I relate to this comment and think it made me more insightful when it comes to communicating with others.

When reading "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" I found myself wanting to send it to a few "Uncle Petes" that I know of. I think it does a great job of addressing how to spread information about the Climate Crisis. This class provides us with all the science, all the facts, all the politics, all the opinions, but we haven't quite learned what to do with this information. This reading gives us the answer. In step by step explanations, we learn how to explain the Climate Crisis to people who may be skeptical of it. The simpleness and "straight to the point" tactic provided is an ample way to show people the truth behind the Climate Criss. Presenting the straight facts is much more productive then attempting to explain every single aspect the issue at hand. We are screwing ourselves over by presenting people with the issue and solution, but not how it will be incorporated in society. This lets deniers run away with crazy ideas what could happen if we start implementing Climate-positive policies. They'll state that we will lose our own individual rights. First off, this is not correct.  Secondly, we're going to lose everything if we don't stop our changing climate. 
               <br><br>

This leads to my main takeaway from this reading; we need more education on the climate. People often know little to nothing about how our world   heats and cools itself, and this is because we don't really learn about in school or society. This lack of education around the climate makes it even easier to turn the Climate Crisis into a divisive political issue. When people are not knowledgable on a topic, they are easily swayed, and will also begin to make their own false assumptions. This is where these simple facts are key. At the end of the reading, we are provided with a list of 6 principles.I think that if something as simple as these 6 principles were shown around the world when we first discovered that the heating of our globe is man-made, perhaps we wouldn't be in the situation we are in now. Now, we must keep moving forward, and educate people best we can,  and help people realize that the Climate Crisis has nothing to do with politics.

I agree with Kacey, this reading was very informative not just about how to communicate climate change but also in general how to craft simple messages and communicate any type of topic. I also after reading this article  sent it to my sister so maybe she could learn how to better communicate (in general) and because she is extremely involved in climate change activism in Oregon and I thought this article might bring a new approach to her form of communication. 

               <br><br>

What I got from Ken's video describing the chapters was that we should be aiming to communicate and motivate with people who skeptic but those who are also in belief of climate change but need motivation and guidance to help them get involved. He also reminded us that they way we word things has an immediate effect on how people perceive what we are saying for example when someone says they are a vegetarian than the people who are not, often think that the vegetarian is judging them for their lifestyle choices and this will not encourage them to be a vegetarian. The way to go about this is to wait for them to ask about your food choices and then you can explain you are a climatarian and are just focused on the impact of climate and that is more understandable.

<br><hr>
I felt similarly with your takeaway from this reading; climate crisis skeptics have relied on their political stances to sway their decisions rather than a humanity approach. For instance, Ken has provided content in a way that has made people treat the climate crisis very differently than they had before. He did not evoke concern from his audience through political ideas or technological standpoints. His effective communication of the climate crisis has made many of us students significantly more aware, more sympathetic, and more wanting to change. But those who have not been able to learn from Ken and hear what he has to offer about the issue, or rather CHOOSE not to learn and educate themselves on something they decide to presumptively make assumptions about, allow room for unjustified division on the topic--where there really should be none. You should not be able to base your entire judgment without setting aside the time to learn and delve into each side of the topic open-mindedly.

I found the advice in the reading regarding communication about climate change very helpful and I liked the fact that they addressed the “Uncle Pete’ figure (who we all encounter at least some point in our lives). One quote from the reading that really stood out to me was, “You don’t label your doctor a radical alarmist. You know, and your doctor knows, that medical science, while imperfect and incomplete, is still good enough to provide advice well worth following.” This metaphor really rings true and I think this is the mindset that our world needs to have. So many climate deniers, like Uncle Pete, have a fixed political mindset that hinders them from seeing the truth of our reality and the truth behind the science. But as we have discussed in class it is not only the climate deniers that we must communicate to but the climate delayers as well. The urgency of our climate situation makes good communication a vital part of our personal advocacy for climate action. As stated in the reading, “the need to drastically reduce global heat-trapping gas and particle emissions is urgent, and the urgency is scientific, not political.” We need to set politics aside and realize that this issue is going to affect us no matter which political party we side with. We will all be affected, so we must all take action. 
               <br><br>

Ken discussed that it is better to wait for someone to come to you when they are ready to talk about climate change rather than lecturing someone without them prompting the conversation. I agree that this tactic is very effective and that someone will be more open to learning when they initiate the conversation rather than when they are bombarded with facts. I am just worried that we don’t have time to wait and that we must communicate now, rather than when the world is ready. The world needs to be ready now and realize the devastating reality we are living. As of now, our world is on a path with a terrifying end. I think that any opportunity we get to communicate this fact, we must try.

I do not personally know an “Uncle Pete” in my life, but I can only imagine how frustrating it would be trying to communicate the facts to them if they are not willing to listen. Both my friends and family have generally been accepting of the climate science and understand that this is a real issue that needs to be addressed. As mentioned in the chapter of the book, I do find it important that before you talk about an issue, you should be as informed as you can before going into a discussion. I feel this is incredibly important because the conversation will be more meaningful because you will have more to share and you can refute any arguments Uncle Pete will make. A rule I have for myself is to not ever speak on an issue unless I have all of the facts because I will most likely lose the discussion and will most likely just ramble due to not having any real information.

When I decided to go vegan, I did so because of my health and for the planet. I did not know that by labeling myself as a vegan that I was communicating to the others that I am “better” or more “just” than others. My roommate who used to be vegan disclosed to me that this was the reason why they went vegan and that when it became popular, that is how vegans portrayed myself. I do not believe this at all and do not think of myself as being better than others. Making the decision to not consume animal products does make a more moral person because I could still be sexist, racist, homophobic, xenophobic, and every list in the book. I was shocked when my roommate told me that because I can not actually believe that people actually thought that. I do not particularly tell everyone I know that I am vegan, but if we do decide to go out and eat, I usually do my research beforehand to see what my options are for the meal. This notion of veganism needs to be reconstructed because it is just wrong of vegans to think of themselves as being better. (those that do) When people ask about my life choices, I will be more mindful of the words I use so I can keep the conversation going instead of shutting it down.

Lucky you. My family is full of Uncle Pete’s and it is one of the most infuriating experiences of my life. My mother happens to be one and when I try to explain that single use plastics are horrible she doesn't care to listen. This class has educated me enough to try to enlighten some of my family members that think it isn't happening. Then coming home from school after turning Vegan is difficult, because similar to you I get ridiculed for trying to do my part in saving the planet and be “moral”. I really agree that you should be educated on a topic before speaking about it because instead of name calling and bickering, it becomes more civil and you can spit facts.


<br><hr>
I like your insight on this week’s reading “Communicating Climate Change Science”. I have some issues communicating some of my eating habits to some family members because the eating with the impact your food has on the environment is semi-new to them. Once explained, they are completely supportive. I couldn’t imagine having these same conversations with less open-minded people that are not willing to learn or change.     I also like how you discussed how the word “vegan” has such a negative connotation. I’ve seen this first hand when my family friend brought his own food to a family party when he went. In my family, it's often seen as rude to deny food and it's taken like you think the food here isn’t good enough for you. My grandma, being the most insulted, confronted him about it and ended up supporting his decision to do so. She wasn’t going to join him in going vegan but she didn’t criticize him for doing so. The way he explained it to her allowed her to understand why he was doing this. I think this emphasizes how important communication strategy is when discussing climate change. Although it should not be seen as a controversial issue, the climate crisis is such due to the climate denier media. People are stubborn and tend to stick to their initial thoughts on a particular topic, but with the right communication we can change their minds and encourage action.

I think one of the most important parts in making a difference in climate change is raising awareness. In order to raise awareness effective communication is key. Something that I found interesting was Ken’s recommendation that you shouldn’t force the climate change conversation but rather allow for others to ask questions and bring up the subject. I thought this was ironic because I assume people would recommend others to raise awareness and force the climate change conversation. 
               <br><br>

In this week's reading “Communicating Climate Change Science” it discussed five different important parts of communicating climate change: Preparation, stories, metaphors, language, and solutions. Being prepared and knowing what one is talking about is important. I appreciated the section in 8.1 where the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change summarized some of the key facts about climate change. It’s alway nice to see government organizations approving climate change science, as it means policies and change may be coming. 
               <br><br>

Another part of the reading I enjoyed was the sentence “Quitting smoking, like quitting using fossil fuels, is not easy to do and in both cases the difficulty in quitting is immediate, while the most important benefits are all long-term.” I liked this metaphor because it compares climate change to a well known thing. While it may be hard to quit smoking, in the long term you will be healthier for it. The same goes with climate change. Leaning off of fossil fuels will be a challenge, however, when we switch to cleaner energy, the planet will be healthier. I think it’s important to use metaphors when speaking about climate change because it allows the public to have a better understanding. 
               <br><br>

The last section that I thought was important was the solutions. I think people must speak about some solutions to climate change when communicating to others. Without speaking about solutions, people will be hopeless and think nothing can be done to stop the progression of the planet.

I liked this comments analysis of the reading and share lots of the same thoughts! This reading was beneficial because it was super informative and offered strategies and tips about how to effectively communicate points so that people will really listen. For example, it outlines a path to follow in a very easy to follow manner. First is preparation, if you don’t know the information well--it is less likely your audience will feel convinced. Additionally, they may have questions and you definitely want to be prepared. Second, stories--personal anecdotes and experiences are especially impactful and can really have the audience pictureing why this is so important. In this text, they used “ Uncle Pete” who doesn’t agree with climate change science which was a great fictional example of a real world climate change denier. I like how they had the scenario at the dinner table where Uncle Pete was walked through his thoughts one at a time and forced to think through it logically so that he too could come to the realization of his false notions. Third, metaphors--you definitely don’t want to go too far with this as to make the subject confusing or too far fetched. However, it is great to see comparisons like “by not eating one hamburger you just said x gallons of water” type of message. Fourth, language--you want to adjust your verbatim to your audiences. If you are speaking with younger children you will need to simplify and vise versa if it is a talented group of scientists perhaps. Lastly, solutions are going to be of great importance to close off and offer some sort of future implication and plans. Overall this reading outlines a great plan when speaking about this subject of climate change for different audiences and levels of understanding. We can take this outside the classroom and into Isla Vista, our hometowns and beyond. Next, I watched Ken’s video and I really appreciated his personal story about how he brings up the climate change conversation in a respectful yet inviting way. It’s true that most people are not climate deniers and are just waiting on some sort of guidance. Ken’s method to describe his diet as a climatarian is awesome--it doesn’t have that same stigma as being vegan rather, it gives you a chance to explain how you support bettering the climate. Overall, I think this is a great system and will definitely use these tactics should I be in a similar situation in the future.

I like the emphasis Ken places on convincing people to take action. Out of all the people I know, I would estimate that a very high percent of them believe in climate change. However, many of them are unwilling to make any change. This is unfortunate because we all need to unite if we hope to see any difference. While I wouldn't expect everyone to start protesting, I would hope that the majority of our population will soon change their actions to reduce our climate footprint and hopefully stop this situation from getting worse.

I think it is a really good idea about how to spread the idea of having an eco-friendly diet. I have seen things like when a person asks another person about their eating habit, and after they heard “vegan” in response, the conversation just stopped with an “oh…” No matter what is the reason for that person being a vegan, people usually have some special/weird attitudes about them. Introducing the idea of freegan and climatarian will not only be good for handling a conversation but also helping with the “bias” people are having towards vegetarian and vegan. People are usually curious and willing to try something they have never heard before. In that situation, it is a really good way for people to start their path of helping or at least decreasing with their carbon footprints. From the perspective of helping with the environmental situation, it is also an easier way to start with rather than changing the living place, transportation and etc..



</p><hr>


<p>

From the reading “Bending the Curve: Climate Changes Solutions.” As Ken mentioned that, he used the word climatarians and freegans to introduce himself instead of vegan. In this way, people might be curious about the name, then we can have more conversation about how to eat to mitigate the climate crisis. Sometimes it might be awkward to tell people that I am vegan myself, like what discussed in the book. It is vital to learn how to communicate such issues with family and friends. When we communicate, it is also essential to be a good listener. As Ken says, when people ask about his diet and lifestyle they usually will have a bunch of questions, then here comes the right time to explain the issue without making people feel they are immoral. 
               <br><br>

We can also use scientific research to back up our statements. Also, be ready with the responses that doubter may have, and prepares with evidence to strengthen our viewpoints. As the book suggested that we can use metaphor to compare the issue with climate change, I like the smoking metaphor Ken used before in the previous lecture it helps us to understand the problem more vividly.

Yea it's a good conversation starter of why a person chose to become a vegan. And in the case for climate change, it opens up a conversation of how veganism can help the climate and how people can help the climate just by eating meat less and not having to fully forgo what they have been eating their whole life. It doesn't seem condescending and is just informative, which is an important part in communicating about the climate crisis. We should be well informed about the subject but also acknowledge that we don't know everything. The chapter provided great points on how to communicate effectively to climate change deniers and as well as people who just want to talk about climate change and gather more information.

Accessibility and ability to interpret scientific information are the most important parts of scientific research - the reason what’s studied is studied is because we, as humans, want answers to the questions that we pose. The climate crisis and the plethora of questions it produces need to be answered, but those answers have long been incredibly convoluted and controversial. 

               <br><br>

The effective communication strategies/terminology that are offered through the chapter are awesome for bringing people into a conversation and covertly educating them on the climate crisis. Rather than argue with deniers, one could focus on statistics or telling stories about real-life impacts of the climate crisis, in either case leaving little room for further denial. Overall I think this was a great reading with plenty of excellent conversational ideas for getting the uncle Pete in your life to finally listen.

Transparency is very important. There's no point of education if people don't understand what they're learning. Another important point is effective communication. I, too, get frustrated talking with climate deniers. I used to think that staying quiet was better (otherwise I'd get angry and frustrated), but I've learned that staying calm and talking slowly goes a long way.

The reading “Communicating Climate Change Science” did a spectacular job of showing tactics and explaining how you can communicate the climate crisis to your friends and family.  At first, when my friends and I talk about climate change, many of them were either in denial that it was happening, or they were unsure whether it was anthropogenic climate change. I found it very frustrating to try and explain to them that this is a real issue that needs to be dealt with immediately. Despite using numerous facts and showing them data from numerous climate scientists and climate change organizations, some of my friends still believed that the data was fabricated by scientists. I knew that if I became frustrated with my friends' claims that I would not be able to share my viewpoint. Instead, I simply withheld from starting conversations about the climate crisis around them and waited for them to bring it up. This method was mentioned in the reading and is highly effective. If someone really wants to talk about something they will be the ones to bring it up and start the conversation. By doing so, I was able to change almost all of my friends' viewpoints on the climate crisis. All my friends except two of them believe that humans are causing climate change and the catastrophic events that have been following close behind. The other two still have become more open-minded about the issue and are willing to hear me out and actually take their time to do their research through unbiased sources. The main issue with climate change is the lack of education in the school systems, but more specifically with the new generations. I found it very interesting in the reading that metaphors can be a very effective way of communicating the climate crisis. This is something I never would have considered because I thought a metaphor could either be picked apart and used against your argument, or it might come off as you thinking your audience is not as intelligent as you. Realistically the usage of metaphors is able to simplify complex parts of the climate crisis. The reading offered many different ways to successfully communicate this debated topic with any audience.

I think it’s so important to note that having this conversation with our friends is definitely one of the hardest things to do. As you pointed out the lack of good education in K-12 makes some people doubt actual good science. And you tend to expect the people in your generation to believe many of the same things as you. Obviously you won’t agree on everything but as a young person in America you tend to think that all young people can agree on the issue that is climate change. Coming to college it is so surprising to see that your friends did not receive the same in depth education on the climate crisis that others did. They are unaware of many things pertaining to the crisis. As you and the reading pointed out is a really good method to not throw a bunch of information at the people that you want to educate. Instead if you wait for them to ask or bring the issue up there’s a greater chance that they’ll actually want to listen to what you have to say and be more open minded.

The author's creation of an "Uncle Pete" was very helpful. There have been times where I've encountered my own version of him and felt frustrated because, despite all the facts and valid points I brought up, they went to dead ears. And I found it cool when the authors specifically mentioned this. When you brought up that there will be skeptics who will deny the facts because it may not be a science topic at all; they may see it as an opportunity for the government to make rules and regulations against markets and our freedom, I felt a sense of relief. Climate change is here and its consequences are very present, it really left me dumbfounded encountering people like Uncle Pete but reading chapter 8 cleared it up.  
               <br><br>

"Communicating Climate Change Science"  was really interesting because it also provided clear ways to go about these kinds of conversations. They emphasized the importance of communicating with simple language and using metaphors like "carbon dioxide is the steroids of our climate" and "The Thermostat" where humans can control the path of the earth but need to act now and right. The authors were clear with their point and the techniques we could go about with skeptics or contrarians, and I think that was a cool thing that they touched on. Throughout this quarter, Ken has stressed the need for human action. In one lecture, he asked whether which of the three do we think is important: political action, environmental activism, and awareness. While the leading vote was the need for political action, you quickly set the record straight that they are all equally important with a follow up i-clicker question. And reading this, I definitely got a sense of that. Being aware is important, especially knowing your subject matter, political action is necessary because it forces the government and people in power to recognize the issue on a global scale and implement necessary changes. They need to be interconnected for there to be real results.

I agree that the author's constant use of Uncle Pete was very helpful in understanding what Somerville conveys. Communicating with people who are climate deniers or climate delayers is something I have always been intimidated by, as it is much easier and enjoyable to talk about a subject with someone who has the same views as you do, but the strategies in which Somerville offers to employ when speaking with a climate denier reassured me. Using metaphors I think is a simple yet effective way to help someone understand what climate change is and why it happens. Specifically, the metaphor about steroids and MLB players is one that can be applied effectively when talking to most male Uncle Petes in America that "don't believe" in climate change. 
               <br><br>


One thing that Ken brings up that got my attention was to let people ask about a climate change related decision you made, instead of forcing your opinion on people about it. Converting climate deniers to supporting things like renewable energy or a largely plant-based diet isn't an easy task, nor one that can happen overnight. Utilizing tactical vocabulary like "climatarian" is a great way to pique people's interest regarding your stance on combatting the climate crisis. Ken's definition of climatarian made me feel better with the diet that I have since I would consider myself a climatarian and not a strict vegetarian or vegan. I can imagine that the popularization of climate vocabulary would definitely play a factor in slowly educating people about the scientific truth about the climate crisis.

I enjoyed this week's reading because it highlighted the importance of communication and having a receptive audience. I feel like it effectively demonstrated and explained why there is such a heated debate over the climate crisis in a way that is almost bipartisan. While it is very frustrating for those who believe in climate change, it is in a way understandable as to why there are still many skeptics claiming it is a hoax and so forth. The solutions towards mitigating the climate crisis constitutes a very large change to cultural norms and the way of life countries such as the United States have become accustomed to. Realizing the wrongs we have incurred on our planet is saddening and embarrassing, after many years of consistent and increasing destruction. Therefore, proposing drastic change is almost guaranteed to be met with argumentative fronts. As a result, communication is a key element in creating movement for change. Effectively communicating the solutions and changes needed to people who are interested and self-motivated is much more efficient than declaring to a greater number of people who have no interest in learning why their habits are wrong and bad. While great, fast change is needed, we must acknowledge the large amount of costs and the new way of life that needs to adopted for the magnitude it is as well. Therefore, a gradual yet fast bridge toward a more environmentally sustainable way of life is, in the long run, more effective than trying to convince the entire population to drastically change their choices. I think communication can be the greatest key element towards creating a movement towards a sustainable life, which is guided by the principles and supporting evidence of a dying planet that needs saving.

We all know a Uncle Pete. I know a Uncle Pete. You know a Uncle Pete. We all know someone that straight up denies that climate change exists. Whether it’s our world leaders or someone we personally know. After reading this piece, I now realize why so many people are so ignorant and will refuse to listen to any facts or science. These skeptics see climate change as an opportunity for the government to make rules and regulations over their lives, to interfere with markets, and to diminish personal freedom and individuals. So even with presented with hard facts and evidence, Uncle Pete will always deny that climate change exists. But what is ironic is that if we do not take action, governments will actually be forced to seize power and limit freedoms. 
               <br><br>

Although climate change is a frustrating and unfortunate topic to talk about, I learned that we need to remember to be warm, positive, and open when trying to communicate with someone about the climate change issues. Sometimes we forget that people come from different educational upbringings, they are not as open or as educated as us and our peers. But despite our differences, we are all part of the same problem and we have to accept and move on. I found this reading to be especially helpful in informing the reader on how to improve their communication skills when it comes to discussing the climate crisis. These communication skills are critical in effectively spreading awareness of climate change. By informing people, we want to motivate them to act. At the end of the day, it is up to all of us to decide and make a change.

I was pleased to see that this week’s reading offered a solution to something I have been struggling with since beginning this class. It's really difficult to communicate with my friends who don’t care about the climate crisis why they should. It can be annoying to them, and as Ken said, they usually immediately shut off when I or someone else brings it up. I really like the word that Ken mentioned, “Climatearian”, as it doesn’t carry the same label as Vegan and other words do. There is such a huge stigma around the word “Vegan” as people usually associate it with people who think highly of themselves and look down on others who don’t choose the same lifestyle as them. This is really upsetting to me because I began vegan has so many good environmental and ethical impacts that are now being immediately dismissed because a few people decided to be annoying about it. That's why words like “climatarian” are really good because they spark conversation and can actually make people think about their own actions instead of judging yours. I will definitely be using that word to describe my own eating habits from now on, and I am curious to see how others react to it. I find this reading to be really important, and I think anyone who cares about climate change should definitely read it as it is so important to know how to spread the word about the climate crisis and make others aware of what is going on. That is the most effective way to spread information and encourage others to make lifestyle changes. I have pushed members of my family to change their eating habits just by showing them what I have learned in this class. It was much more effective to show them how they could make an impact instead of bragging about how good my choices are and trying to make them feel guilty. The five categories to communicate climate change are very simple: preparation with knowledge, stories related to people who do not accept climate change, metaphors, tools for communication, a language with precise description, and solutions to provide optimistic tools. None of these are difficult or hard to remember, and if everyone knew how to use them, I think anyone could make an impact.

I completely agree. It can be incredibly frustrating trying to explain the importance of such prominent and relevant issues when people simply do not care and refuse to listen. I find it very sad that there is such a huge stigma around being vegan because it is such a great thing for so many reasons. While I am not completely vegan myself, I admire everyone who makes this decision. I also agree that bringing new words in such as "climatarian" is a great way to spark conversation and spread knowledge about the climate crisis. This way people can learn more about the little changes that they can make that will make a difference, rather than shutting down a conversation that has not even started. I really enjoyed this reading because I think that this information is so important. Sharing knowledge about this crisis is vital to putting an end to it. These five categories seem fairly simple and we could all definitely start using them more often.

I really appreciate Professor Hiltner’s attitude of tolerance and humbleness regarding his own beliefs. It must be difficult to simultaneously be passionate about such an important issue and be tolerant towards others’ personal choices. I used to think of Vegans as “holier than thou” folks but I do not anymore. 
               <br><br>
As for the reading, I find Somerville’s defense of science to be very compelling. Furthermore, he is exactly right in stating that the Climate Crisis is much more  than a scientific topic. It is a “human” topic, whatever that means. In an age of science skepticism, it is important to be able to explain the Climate Crisis in a way which motivates the largest amount of people.
               <br><br>
Regarding the author’s mentioning of Christianity, I find it interesting that Christians in this country are not more vocal about the climate crisis. I think Jesus of Nazareth would’ve been a climate activist in the sense that the Biblical message includes prosperity for all humankind. If this religion does indeed consider the earth, men, and nature as sacred, then there is absolutely no reason for Christians to not be concerned about the Climate Crisis.

Although, yes, climate change is a very scientific topic that can only be learned and understood by researchers and scientists through the use of data and real scientific evidence, most of us are not scientists. Thus, the evidence presented to the general public must reflect that in order to make much, if any, sense. Like you said, in categorizing the climate crisis as a “human” topic rather than a strictly scientific one as Somerville does, it allows the general public to relate  much more easily. In redesigning the way climate change is learned by common people, those teaching need to consider and focus much attention to the accessibility of the information. Finding ways in which people may relate to the information they’re learning about is, by far, the most effective method in encouraging people to take action and create change. This is true because at the end of the day, humankind is a selfish species. There are a great number of people who care for others, the planet, and the wellbeing of all life on Earth, but we do all maintain some degree of self interest. We are designed to first and foremost look out for the interests of ourselves and for maintaining our survival. In this regard, the best way to make people want to take action and actually follow through with it is to present the information, whether it be specific facts or general warnings, in an accessible, comprehensible way that relates to an individual's life and survival. When these concerns are threatened, an individual will take action in order to protect and sustain themselves.

I agree with you about Ken’s tolerance towards other people’s personal choice. In addition, I found the communication skills really matter. I have experienced the similar situation that when I, at some point, was obsessed with something and keeps talking about it with my family and my friends, they often appear to be indifferent about it while I was supposing that they should be somewhat passionate about what I was talking about. The idea of leaving them alone for a while until they are ready to listen to you is really effective. Being too enthusiastic talking about one thing could actually scare them off and make them think “oh, gash, what is he talking about” and thus make them less patient rather than intriguing them to your topic. Also, I believe it would be effective if we can approach the climate change in a human perspective instead of a scientific perspective since science just seems too far away from most of our regular people. Most people can not judge science from a professional view point. Rather, they could only feel which one seems to make sense, which could be misleading. However, by approaching this problem from a human perspective, people can better understand what is the climate crisis all about and thus make the right decision to act upon it rather than waiting until it is too late to reverse all the negative impact.



<br><hr>

I also admire Ken's attitude and I think his more passive approach, waiting for people to ask him, reflects his passion because it seems to be the best way to communicate these ideas in a way that will be received. It is not, however, easy to feel so passionately about sollutions, to understand so well the urgency of the situation, and to wait for people to be ready to receive the information. This reading and lecture were about the role of communication in solving the crisis and we have seen before, like with Rachel Carson's Silent Spring that there is a gap between the science and the people that must be filled by strong communicators. To be a strong communicator, one must understand how people receive information and especially when pushing for lifestyle changes, one must understand people's connection to their habits and beliefs. I think especially at this point, while the climate crisis can't be explained without science and science will continue to play an essential role in stopping it, the more pressing focus should be on communicating the problem and understanding how to shift our values and systems, which is more of a social science problem, or a "human" topic. Christianity can also be interpreted as promoting anthropocentrism, giving mankind dominion over the earth. I agree that there is also a lot about christianity that could be used to promote environmentalism within the religion. I found the part about the evangelical christians in the reading to be very interesting because it really is about interpretation and about leadership. The reading highlighted that people tend to trust those who share their values. Very religious people tend to associate with conservatives who tend to oppose environmental protection. Pockets that break away from this and represent contraries to the norm are important because they represent our ability to think critically and make decisions separate from the groups we associate with.

I also agree with you that the climate crisis is much more than a scientific topic because the topic with climate is in multi-angles and includes a lot of other concerns. One of the concerns is humans, specifically related to morality and ethic. Humans are not only the causes and origins of the jeopardized climate crisis but also the audience of pro-environmental-friendly actions and measures. In one sense, we are the destroyers and the saviors. Therefore, it is important to communicate the idea of the climate crisis to more people as more and more will abandon the sense of destroyer and become the saviors. I also very agree with the author's idea that we should know our audience before communicating the topic of the climate crisis because this would make our arguments more specific and compelling to the ones we are going to communicate. All the author argues are ways that would enhance our ability to promote the idea of the climate crisis, which I believe is the action that we can all fulfill in daily life and is better and more direct than just complaining that the problem is too difficult to solve.


<br><hr>
I never really thought about this. I too also appreciate Ken's attitude of tolerance and humbleness. I appreciate how we doesn't shame us for living our carbon-heavy lifestyles. Additionally, I appreciate how Ken advises us to treat those who are uneducated about the climate crisis with the same respect with someone who does. We don't solve problems by making enemies out of our opponents. Instead, we have to work with them and convince them using respectful and clean tactics. 
               <br><br>

I thoroughly enjoyed this week's reading. It provided me with a wealth of knowledge that is extremely helpful in my daily life. I appreciate how this chapter provided so many analogies and examples that can be used to help convince others to adopt a similar mindset. I also appreciate how easy to read this chapter was. This is the type of resource that I can send to other like-minded people because it is easy to read and informative. With this knowledge, I am actually very excited to start advocating my beliefs and educating others.





<br><hr>
I agree with you that I appreciate how Professor Hiltner remains his own belief no matter what his friends or surroundings may think about him. I respect people who follow their own opinions and who don’t follow the trend. For the reading, I learned a lot of strategies and approaches that climate crisis communicators should do or avoid. For instance, metaphors and stories are the right directions that lead or attract the audience to pay extra attention to the issues. The communicator should use a simple way or widely understood method to let the audience understand the issues so that scientific theory sometimes complicates the problem, which reduces its effectiveness of delivering a message.
               <br><br>
Additionally, I like how the reading compares medical science with climate change. They both share several ordinary things, such as how we all know that we should listen to doctors or scientists’ advice, but we sometimes choose to deal with devastating and unexpected consequences. The critical thing is that it is a cultural and environmental issue rather than a political issue. Everything depends on all of humanity and our actions, as we are the dominant factor in the control of climate change.

I agree with you about Ken’s tolerance towards people who do not understand the situation that climate crisis is related to eating habit and prefer eating a meat-based rather than plant-based diet. Everyone’s opinion should be respected, and everyone has the right to decide what to eat, but given the reality that eating meat causes damage to the environment, I believe many people would be willing to eat less meat. Communication is a technique. Simply telling people that eating meat is wrong is obviously unfavorable. Instead of accepting the advice, people are more likely to reject and consider vegans, or climatarians in this situation, incomprehensible. What we should do to allow people understand the importance of eating plant-based diet is by influencing. Ken’s method is very recommendable. Mentioning the word climatarian instead of claiming himself as vegan will raise people’s curiosity and will create new conversation that leads to the climate problem. When people are curious about something, they are more likely to accept the ideas that they receive, and thus choose to eat an eco-friendlier diet than he normally does. 
               <br><br>
I also agree about what was mentioned in the reading that climate crisis is more like a human topic than a scientific topic. Politically, the problem is about how to find a balance between a change in the economic system and a compensation to people who lose from the change and how to let people fall into a consensus that the change is necessary. To normal people who are aware of the climate crisis, it is about how to influence people around them to be environmentalists. Science change is necessary, but human practice is much more harder to carry out and this is what we should focus on.



<br><hr>
I agree, climate change is a topic that requires science and facts to understand, however, change must come from the people. Without changes in the lifestyles of people all over the country the climate crisis will continue to worsen. We need to end our reliance on fossil fuels and lessen the amount of beef that we consume. While individual action will not solve the issue, it is a necessary component of the solution. If people change their consumption habits, companies will notice it and hopefully make a change.
               <br><br>
As well as personal action, there needs to be a huge political shift in this country. The fossil fuel and agricultural companies have way too much power over politicians. They are preventing climate change legislation and further allowing those companies to exploit our planet for a profit.





<br><hr>

I agree with your comment about Ken's tolerance for people's decisions. However, I found a lot of people who just don't care about the climate crisis. It is unacceptable for them by simply telling them "your diet habits will influence the climate". For me, communication is a sophisticated art that requires lots of experience and technique. Telling people the concept of freegan or climatarian is obviously better than asking people to be vegan. The former means would lead people who curious about freegan or climatarian to make research by themselves and eventually some of them will become climatarian .




<br><hr>
I completely agree with you that we need to make the scientific information about climate change easier to understand to the public. Some may see and hear this information and continue with their day there though maybe, “ok and what do you want me to do with this information, that's cool and all but why should I care I can’t do anything.”  Ken does a really good job at telling his students and maybe others around him what they can do to reduce their carbon emissions and why it is so important that we do. The problem with this is that everybody can’t take his class to get a well thought out plan and breakdown of what climate change, how it is affecting us on the daily and what we can do to help. Fortunately he has us, his students taking his class and we can spread this information to the people around us. 

<br><br>
I also think it is smart that he utilizes this class to educate the public by making everything available online. I have noticed people who aren’t in this class that comment occasionally. Rather than restricting access to this course through the university he realizes that it is a “Human topic”, not just a student topic. Not everyone has access to furthering their education but they should have access to educating themselves about the planet they live on. That’s what I think a “human” topic is ; it’s something that everyone should care about. Scientists are needed to put statistics and understanding to the issue at hand but it takes the public to put change into effect.




<br><hr>

I agree with you.  In the reading, I also found Somerville's defense of science to be very interesting.  The Climate Crisis is much more than a science topic.  Regarding it as just a science topic would make it seem as not as important.  This is not the case at all.  It is very important and should be seen as something that is very deadly.  I don't want to sound too extreme, but this is the truth.  If we do not pay attention or see it as more than just a science topic then it will have chaotic results.  We necessarily will not feel those effects, but future generations will definitely be feeling them.  The consequences that would be brought would be worst years and years from now and it will affect the generations that still are not alive yet.  It will affect our children's children.  It is also stated that it is a "human topic."  At first I did not exactly know what this meant but after a while I was able to determine what I think it might means.  I think when the statement, it is a "human" topic was said it was supposed to show that this topic far exceeds just science.  It hits different important points for us humans and our way of living, but most importantly the place we live on and that is our planet, Earth.  Ignoring the obvious issue would cause certain chaotic effects to our home, our planet.  It would completely destroy Earth, and it would be completely our fault.




<br><hr>


I completely agree with you comment. I like Ken’s approach to people with different viewpoints. He was setting a good example of how we should be more tolerant. I sometimes find the climate crisis to be very polarizing and political, even though it shouldn’t be. Just as the reading discussed, climate change is not a political issue! We must stop politicizing it, otherwise we will never get both sides to agree. Climate change is a scientific issue and should be seen as one. People trust doctors and medical personnel, but don’t seem to trust climate scientists. This is a problem that needs to be changed through education and a shift in culture. I also really liked that the book discussed how important communication is. Recognizing that writers must be direct, easy to understand, and know their audience, are all critical steps in getting people to understand climate change. We cannot win a fight against climate change if we cannot communicate effectively. 
                <br><br>

It is also an issue that people often think that those who are environmentally conscious are “holier than thou”. As someone who is vegetarian, we have to do a better job of not pushing our ideas onto others. It definitely served as a good reminder to wait for people to come to me with questions, instead of bombarding them with information they never asked for. If we approach the issue of climate change compassionately, we could sway more people.



<br><hr>

I completely agree on what you stated above. It is hard to keep passion on issues such as climate crisis and tolerant toward others' choice which might be hurtful to the Earth. 
                <br><br>
As what Somerville said, the climate issue definitely is a topic larger than simply scientific topic, but a human one. Simply depending on scientific development certainly cannot change our current situation. In order to save the mankind from the seventh extinction, everyone has to make improvement and do things differently. 
                <br><br>
In addition, I agree with you that the theory of Christianity should lead the believers to concern about the Climate Crisis, though the fact is not a lot of Christians contribute themselves on climate issues.




<br><hr>

I was also drawn to Somerville’s statement that climate change is more of a “human topic” than a strictly scientific one. Many times, scientists have tried and failed to communicate their findings to the public, mainly because of their presentation’s heavy concentration of hard facts, statistics, and data. As the author covers in his chapter, in order to engage the many audiences with climate change, one must learn to communicate their findings in a way that can relate personally with the masses. 
                <br><br>
This idea is not a new one and has come up in many of the environmental lectures I have attended in the past. One specific lecture by Katherine Hayhoe that I attended entitled “Science In A Fact-free World”, addressed this specific topic. She presented statistics that showed how many people prefer to validate their opinions, not through science, but through the points made by politicians or people in power (basically people with charisma). However, at the end of her lecture, Hayhoe provided her audience with similar tips to those discussed in Somerville’s writing. She stated that the best method to approach when communicating climate change is to relate it to your audience in some way. Whether this is by comparing your environmental values to that of your audiences’ ethical or religious ones, or by showing how climate change is personally affecting them, this method allows people to form a deeper connection with this subject. And when these deep connections are formed, people are more inclined to act on them.




<br><hr>
I agree with you in that I also appreciate Ken's tolerance towards others' beliefs and lifestyles and his humbleness regarding his own. It is quite obvious that Ken's choices are much more beneficial to the planet than other choices; however, it is important to note that, thinking back, Ken never tried to evangelize us about adopting his lifestyle. This really endeared me to him and made me want to listen to what he had to say more. I think it also helps erase the stigma of eco-friendly people being holier-than-thou. I'm certain that a lot of people refrain from becoming vegan or minimalists because many people who are are quite annoying and quite frankly, condescending about it. I'm still shocked that people never realized that if you want others to eat no meat and be minimalistic, don't call meat the enemy and don't call our stuff disposable junk--that just makes people want to eat meat more and hoard even more possessions. And it'll never get people to start living a similar lifestyle. Even for people who have moved on beyond the holier-than-thou attitude and, they often try to hide that they're living a more eco-friendly lifestyle. I completely agree with Ken that no one should advertise how they're living in a way that is so much more eco-friendly than everyone else. However, I think it is disappointing when people are so quiet about their eco-friendly ways that no one even has the chance to ask and learn.





<br><hr>

I agree with you that I use to have a bit of a stigma against vegans because I felt that they were kind of condescending and act like they are better than you. Ironically I am a vegan and have been for some time now, so I know that this stigma might come from a few vocal vegan that do not represent the entire group. I would completely agree the role of religion in this case, particularly Christianity. It seems that a central idea in Christianity is to look out for people and to be kind to those around us etc. We know the effects of climate change are directly putting people at risk, it seems that this should be a huge deal to the christian world. I think at least part of this might have to do with the politicization of both climate change and religion. For example climate change action is very much a liberal agenda, compared to the conservative values that many Christians have.




<br><hr>
I really agree with what you said, Luca Marconi. It is do hard for our professor to support and try to explain the climate problem because of the progressing of our society and all kinds of defenses from others. I really like your comment on vegan that talks about “holier than you.” From my perspective, religion is always a sensitive topic for climate problem. In Christianity culture, human would always be the first or the top thing instead of environment. Therefore, it would be hard for environmentalist to convince the “tradition” without finding forcible data or events. Most importantly, it would be necessary to put everything in a equal place such as human, animal, and plants. In this way, people can be much easier to realize the con of devastating other lives and our atmosphere.





<br><hr>

I agree with you. Ken is incisive to the point and sees clearly the people’s feelings about veganism. We definitely need not only a complete picture of the truth but also a correct way to communicate with other people. The author of the book, Richard, inspires me with his insistence on the power of scientific truth. We need to be really strategetic when talking to people like Uncle Pete and always try to choose the right way. 

                <br><br>

I appreciate Ken’s word that “before you can change the world, you need to change yourself.” There is an old saying in my home culture, says that “One can't make a by success without being self-reliant.” I would say that the most effective way to communicate with others is your action and ongoing climate-protecting lifestyle.



<br><hr>

I completely agree with your response. I also used to think of vegans as looking down upon people with different lifestyles. This actually encouraged me into becoming vegan a few years ago, and I followed a similar path as Ken, where I cut out fish, then meat, then all animal products. Now, however, I am a vegetarian and try to be aware of the climate impact of the foods I choose to eat. I try to steer away from soy because I know it requires a lot of water, and have recently been choosing to use oat milk more often as it uses the least amount of water of most non-dairy milks. I found your response to the author's mention of Christianity to be really interesting. Although I am no longer very religious, I used to be Christian when I was in high school. I definitely used to see the world as something that humans should protect, and saw my environmentalist views connected with what I would learn in church about love and respect for all living things. Although I think it is a pretty big overgeneralization that Christians have little concern about the environment, I do think that Christians can do more to advocate. My own personal connections that I made to the environment were not mentioned much at all in my church. Some Christians I knew saw livestock as being placed on this earth by God for human consumption, which I think can start some issues in regards to environmentalism.

I found Professor Hiltner's open-mindedness and awareness refreshing. Many people in the world are not aware of how their actions are being received, or think about other people's thoughts at all. There is now an understanding that the more you try to convince someone of changing their lifestyle, the more dug in they become. Even if someone is passionate about something, like Ken is about making a personal effort to lessen the climate crisis, they will only change when they are ready. The idea that Professor Hiltner and our reading "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" suggest is to let them come to you. It is then, when you can explain your life choices, and imply that they do the same. However when you are doing this, be aware of the words you are using. For example, vegan has a negative connotation because of the stigma surrounding it, so use climatarian instead. It raises questions, rather than shutting down the conversation.
                <br><br>

The section about Christianity stood out to me as well. Jesus Christ would most certainly be concerned about the climate crisis that we are dealing with today. Not only is the Earth in danger, but the people and animals on it are as well. Jesus wanted the best for all living things. I would think that Jesus would be a vegan, minimalist, and climate activist. It confuses me why more people of Christian faith wouldn't at least consider these options, as the saying "what would Jesus do" is so common in their practice.

I agree. Climate change should be an issue more important to Americans, and for all that are Christians, thinking about how God would want his people to take care of the world he gave them, as well as humankind, is a great call to action. The only thing though is that that mindset only motivates people who actually believe in climate change to take action. That's why the techniques on communicating the reality and severity of climate change discussed in this week's reading are so important. It's important to be able to clearly communicate the truth about climate change to people with doubts like Uncle Pete. Making sure people know that climate change is real in the first place is the first step. Then comes the call to action.

I like how Luca began his comment by appreciating Ken’s habits of communicating his own beliefs. Through the videos on this YouTube channel, and by constructing this English 23; Climate Crisis 101 course himself, Professor Hiltner is demonstrating Richard Somerville’s advice on how to talk about the climate crisis to skeptics and deniers. Ken’s videos are not oversaturated with facts and statistics and use relatable examples and effective videos that portray his speech. His videos are broken up so each video relays concise and simple messages, and he gives amazing solutions and actions we can easily incorporate into our daily lives. Ken is a perfect example of a very competent communicator on the topic of the climate crisis and sometimes I wish I could have someone level headed like Ken by my side to explain the crisis when I try to talk about it with my parents. 
                <br><br>

Regarding Ken’s advice on how to communicate with friends and family who believe in the climate crisis but are not sure how to go about taking action, I thought his point about waiting for others to ask questions rather than eagerly conversing about your knowledge on the topic was incredibly mindful and effective. His advice on how to even get people to ask questions was very thoughtful as well; unfortunately, there exists stereotypes and preconceived notions about people who tell others they are “vegetarian” or “vegan,” and one way to combat those negative connotations is simply by changing our word choice and calling ourselves a “climatarian” or “freegan.” This opens up the conversation of what that even means because those labels are not as widely understood, as of yet. These newer labels are not only helpful for initiating climate change communication, but are helpful for people like me who felt like I was biting more than I can chew when telling others I have started trying to go vegan. It is a weird concept how words and labels can shape our thoughts and emotions, but simply calling myself a climatarian instead of “trying to go vegan” makes me feel less cognitive dissonance. The act of telling others “I am going vegan” made me feel bad whenever I succumbed to eating one egg, but calling myself a “climatarian” now shifts my mindset into thinking it is okay not to go from 0 to 100 in a snap of a finger, as long as I overtime, keep making more and more changes in my eating habits for the health of the climate. When Ken asks if being a climatarian or freegan is enough, I think as long as we do not stagnate or take too long in reaching complete vegetarian or veganism, little changes will amount to great change.

I've taken a small seminar with Ken before so I got to know him and his personal beliefs and lifestyle choices decently well -- and I agree with you that I feel very appreciative to be able to learn from someone so passionate and dedicated to his beliefs yet tolerable of others'. From the seminar I learned that he biked to campus everyday to teach and was a minimalist, which I found to be super cool. Some people claim to be climate change activists but don't really act on it or change their lifestyle in any way to combat it, but Ken actually leads by example which is really inspiring. What is even more impressive is that he never really advertised these life choices, but rather lets his students and others around him bring it up first. This ties into the reading "Communicating Climate Change Science" because it underscores the point that you should never initiate climate change topics because people can get turned away by it. People will often assume things about your character and your perceptions and thus the conversation will never go anywhere. It was interesting to learn from Ken and the reading that certain words can be conversation starters or get people interested in learning more. To combat the climate crisis as a unified whole, we must learn how to communicate with the Uncle Petes all around the world.

I agree that the climate crisis is more of a “human" topic. Many people are aware of the issue but they do not know what to do about it. They might be resistant to drastic changes such as switching to a vegan diet completely. I love Ken’s tolerance regarding his beliefs. People should be eating whatever they want. But we have to let them know the stories behind their diet. When you purchase a 16oz steak at a supermarket, you do not see animals being slaughtered. When I eat a juicy burger, I do not see farms and cows. All of us take the food for granted as if the supermarket created food. Unlike our hunter-gatherer ancestors, we enjoy the benefit from agriculture. There is something missing in our heads. People don’t think about what are the foods come from quite often. It is our responsibility to know what we send into our stomach as the No.1 predators in the food chain.

Yes! Me too. I am vegan myself (and will continue using that word since I am not only vegan for the environment, but for the lives of the animals too) and it is always refreshing to hear someone speak on the subject with a similar point of view as mine. All of the vegans I know are very compassionate, understanding people. For example, if your budget and free time does not allow for you to eat a vegan diet, than so be it. Choosing to sub beans for beef in your Taco Bell burrito is doing more than nothing at all. All small changes eventually add up to make big ones. Now, I mentioned before that I am vegan for the animals. I cannot stand knowing I caused the suffering of another living, sentient being. This means that I do not think that substituting a turkey burger for red meat is acceptable in the big picture-- BUT-- I do think it is the perfect solution if you are vegan for the environment! Or, as how Ken puts it, a "climatarian."
                <br><br>
And yes, Somerville's chapter was a very compelling read, especially with all of the stories. I also enjoyed his positive, optimistic outlook on things. I think the Climate Crisis is a "human" topic because it affects all of us, and is not knowledge that should be confined to the elite, educated "scientist" population.



<br><hr>


I agree with all aspects of your comment. I find Ken’s tolerance and humbleness very compelling and a tool that might actually be effective in persuading people to change their lifestyles in order to help the climate crisis. I used to think of vegans as “holier than thou” folks but after having been educated in the climate crisis more this quarter I find them inspiring. 
                 <br><br>
I think this reading along with this course in general displays as to the issue of climate change has become more of a “human” topic than a scientific topic because we know the basic facts already. Not only that but while science can help, it is more effective for us to change our living habits to more sustainable lifestyles in order to drastically cut down our carbon emissions. Ken has shown us numerous ways and examples to this in present time with the technology that is available now and therefore we need to focus on the human aspect of this now. I also think Jesus would be a climate activist.



<br><hr>

I agree with you in that the climate crisis needs to be tackled through multiple perspectives rather than just scientific. Often times when we see that the oceans are rising and the temperature is rising we automatically look to the STEM field for solutions. What is unrealized is these problems are intersectional and can only be solved through an eclectic view point. For example the effects of climate change will impact cultures and the way we live our everyday lives. To help lead this change we need people in the humanities to help navigate these crucial changes that need to take place if we plan on reducing our carbon emissions in order to create a better future for the upcoming generations.  What I really liked about the actual reading is that we were able to actually view climate change for what it is. They stripped away the fallacies and were able to directly inform us about climate change and provided solutions that we can adapt. This was a polar opposite to the reading funded by the Heartland Institute. I also appreciated Ken's tolerance. As he said in the ending people have to come to terms on their actions on their own time and must want to change their personal behavior before tackling the world.




<br><hr>
I also appreciated his approach to communicating his beliefs and practices as a climatarian. Ken's approach is a humble one, it is a way of teaching by doing... it doesn't come off as snobby or arrogant because instead of hitting everyone with "OH IM VEGAN BY THE WAY" like I've heard many others claim before, Ken demonstrates what he is trying to communicate by just living out what he lectures on. I think it is important that we as students in this class, where we have learned so much, follow after the example of our dedicated professor.





<br><hr>

After reading "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions", I realized how important it is to frame communication about the climate crisis in a way that appeals to people's core beliefs and passions. I also used to believe that vegans had a mentality that they held beliefs that made them more righteous than the average person. However, this was mostly due to the fact that the conversation revolved around their own personal achievements rather than the reasoning behind their choices. After taking several environmental studies classes, I realized that many people have made this choice for many positive reasons, such as improving their own health and helping their environment. Learning about these choices made me realize that being vegan isn't as radical of an idea as many stereotypes portray it to be. Therefore, I believe that when having conversation about veganism or the environmental crisis, its important to frame conversations in a way in which people can feel involved. Conversations about such topic should involve educating and allowing for people to explore the topic and present their own curiosity without judgment. In regards to religion and the environment, I believe that many conversations could be initiated by drawing the comparison between the sacred nature of the environment and the importance of preserving sacred land and creations. I believe that using this mindset and framing can help open many conversations with people who may initially be turned away from having a conversation about the environment.




<br><hr>
I, too, see how Ken is beyond our level of thinking. His openness and need to circumnavigate the social boundaries of mankind to benefit the climate crisis is truly profound. What better way to spark debate and openness for discussion than just raising a question about one’s diet; it’s ingenious. Had I not taken this course and someone told me they were a climatarian when it came to diet. I also would ask that person as to what that is and why they are doing it. I wouldn’t have shut down anything even if I were uncomfortable because Ken or whoever the climatarian was would have had my attention and curiosity. You don’t really consider this aspect of trying to get support for the climate crisis, but it’s so important to consider because if someone is closed off to any idea, to begin with, they are going to be far less receptive to making any changes to their own lifestyle in order to match whatever you’re talking about, and in this case, it’s your dietary routine.

As someone who relates to several sides of this comment (A Christian and a Climatarian), this is a struggle that I face a lot. It's frustrating to feel that politically, my religion is a driving force in climate denial. people even quote bible verses like the ones in the story of Cain and Abel to explain why eating meat is ok - the vegan is the bad guy in that story, murders a meat eater, in fact.
                 <br><br>

My interpretation of Jesus has always been that he would align a lot more with idea of social reform, rather than those of the status quo, given the way he interacts in the books of the gospels. I think that would surely involve protecting and nurturing the planet, especially since that is a huge part of the story of creation.
                 <br><br>

I also have a really hard time communicating to my christian friends. It sounds silly, but people often really go the bible for everything, and can't be bothered that the world is in jeopardy right now. I am grateful for some ideas that Ken shared, and am going to use those tips to improve the way I communicate.




<br><hr>
I also really appreciate Professor Hiltner’s respectful attitude and find it very admirable because I personally do have a hard time sometimes being super patient with things that I feel very passionate about. The climate crisis is definitely not only a scientific topic, but also a human topic. As not all people have a background in science, the climate crisis needs to be portrayed in a way that the general public can more easily understand. If the topic is too scientific, many people either may not understand or will not be interested in trying to learn more about it because it may be too overwhelming. The point that you brought up about Christians in this country not being very vocal about the climate crisis was very interesting. It does make sense that Jesus would have been a climate activist. I really like how this reading gave the reader ways  to talk about the climate crisis in a way that is easily understandable for most people. This reading was overall very interesting and a great tool for people that want to spread the climate crisis.

I agree with you in that I very much respect Ken's attitude of being humble with his own beliefs. It is very impressive in how he utilizes his recommended tactics in order to communicate his beliefs in a friendly matter that invites outsiders into his lifestyle rather than shunning them. With the popular meme/stereotype of vegans always preaching their beliefs in an annoying manner, communicating climate-friendly and sustainable living lifestyles appropriately is incredibly important when discussing it with those who are unaware of these types of lifestyles and are curious. As if it can be almost hit or miss leaving someone with a distaste for vegans/environmentalists if they take you as being arrogant and judgemental. With Ken's very approachable methods of not really initializing the conversations on your climate beliefs, it can be much more effective and spread knowledge to unknowing people and potentially persuade them to take similar actions to reduce their carbon footprint. Also when communicating these ideas, it can be much more open and intriguing to discuss the topic on a social level rather than a scientific one. By simply explaining your beliefs and the basic concepts of climate change I am sure more people will actively listen rather if you threw out huge statistics and unknown chemicals harming our atmosphere. Communicating climate change discussion effectively can thus be an example of being the change you want to see in the world.



<br><hr>


I too appreciate Ken's tolerant attitude and humble convictions regarding the climate crisis. As I read through Somerville's chapter, I could think of all the 'Uncle Pete's" that I have had to deal with in my life. I  think there are a lot more "Uncle Pete's" than people think, especially as we live in a bubble of a public university. While liberal ideas and environmental consciousness/awareness largely dominate this youth-dominated community, a lot of other places do not share the same characteristics. I commend Ken's approach to bridging this divide, because forcing issues on others often tends to push them away from that issue. It is not about opening up a debate on the issue with others, but instead creating a dialogue on the issue of climate change that can begin to truly influence skeptics' opinions on the matter. I think this is due to a dialogue being more of an open-minded space where people are just talking to each rather than explicitly trying to sway someone to their argument on a certain subject.



<br><hr>


I also really appreciate Ken's attitude and find it kind of enlightening. To effectively communicate the problem and our solutions, we need to use topics and language that promotes discussions, not end them. Flat out saying don't use cars, don't fly and  don't eat beef can be scary to many Americans, and when people get scared they tend not to listen to reason. Introducing these topics in a way that people can understand, I feel would go a long way to help communicate what needs to be done to fix our situation. 
                 <br><br>
Adding on to the topic of not understanding,  when the reading mentioned scientific jargon, it is far too true. Scientific jargon is not easy to understand, it is very specific and has deep complicated definitions. I would never try to or even want to talk physics with anyone outside the physical sciences, for they would immediately lose interest because they would not understand. That's not to say it is the scientist's fault that people cannot understand them. Scientific papers are not written for people outside of their specific subject to ever read. It is like a different language, someone needs to be translating it, so everyone can understand.



<br><hr>
The religious side of this is extremely angering, because you are right; Christianity and it's teachings would lead us to believe that its followers would be more conscious of the climate crisis and actually believe in it, but it isn't the case. I have first hand experience with this, as I have some family from Mississippi. A few years ago during a Christmas Eve service at my grandmother's church, I was expecting to hear the story of Mary and Joseph having baby Jesus in a manger etc. Instead, I was bombarded with the pastor nearly yelling at the pews of my grandma's neighbors and their families about the "preposterous" nature of the scientific community. He began denouncing evolution, the Big Bang theory, and global warming. He claimed that you cannot be a "godly" human if you support such "anti-godly" ideas. I understand why Christians dislike the Big Bang theory and evolution, but I wondered why global warming was an issue. My grandmother disagrees with her pastor on many things he says, but she refuses to stop going to church because of this. She told me that the people in her church believe that global warming cannot be real because god will protect us from planetary doom. There is no way we could all suffer from such a crisis with god on our side. Hearing this was kind of sad, because I know many people out there, like my mom, who believe in science but also are religious. I don't know why so many religious people think they can only pick one side.

I also agree with you that climate change/ the climate crisis is more than scientific topic. Even though it is technically is a scientific topic, it is also a “human topic” in the sense that the people reading the papers about the climate crisis aren’t all scientist and I liked the way, the book “Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions”, put it in how scientist writing these papers need to use less jargon, that the common citizen wont understand, but rather use words that mean the same thing just simplified. I also agree with you on the topic of Christianity, if the climate crisis was going during the time Jesus walked on this earth, he would’ve been a climate change activist, because the earth is a sacred land for man- kind, but at the same time it’s plagued with sin. “The earth dries up and withers, the world languishes and withers, the heavens languish with the earth. The earth is defiled by its people; they have disobeyed the laws, violated the statutes and broken the everlasting covenant.  Therefore a curse consumes the earth; its people must bear their guilt. Therefore, earth’s inhabitants are burned up, and very few are left.” Isaiah 24:4-6

I fully agree. I think it's admirable that Ken retains such humbleness and tolerance involving the thing he is most passionate about. In addition, it has taken some time and new perspectives to come to appreciate how he is always respectful, mindful, and never shameful in his teaching to an audience consumed by consumerism. 


<br><hr>
I agree that Ken’s tolerance is admirable, as for me at least it’s hard to look forgivingly on those whose openly refute scientists’ research. As this week’s reading said, “Everybody is entitled to his own opinions, but not to his own facts.” We all know at least one Uncle Pete, and it can be infuriating to argue a topic that you’re passionate about to someone who looks science dead in the eye and still tries to wave it off. I really appreciate that this book gives the common claims used by climate change deniers, and then refutes them. For me personally, I’ve heard almost all of these false arguments from my dad, especially the one about “global cooling” being predicted when he was a kid. It’s really helpful to know how to refute these claims! The metaphors section was also really useful in thinking of ways to explain the climate crisis.

I really enjoyed this weeks reading for a lotto reasons, but one main reason is that it begins by giving simple details that are true. For starters, as stated in "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions”, humans must first realize that we are all part of the same species and need to work together to survive this mass extinction. People need to stop thinking it's a massive conspiracy and accept the reality; that we are in the middle of a mass extinction that could wipe out our whole population. I think one of the 1st things that needs to happen if we want to have any chance. It is important for influential politicians to stand by with our generation and others who will face the climax of the climate crisis. If we aren't all on the same page, there won't be enough time to save our planet as little progress will be done within the next few decades.

As a comm major, I found this week's reading particularly interesting because it focused on specific actions that you can take to be an effective advocate for the environment.

                 <br><br>

One new thing that I learned was that there are terms when used by scientists or professionals have a completely different meaning; for example, the term "positive feedback," which usually means good response or praise, in the context of the climate crisis actually means a vicious, self-reinforcing cycle. I realized how important it is to know your audience and use the appropriate language for them.

                 <br><br>

I really like that Ken mentioned his experience with veganism and sharing it with his friends. I do agree that while veganism sounds like a drastic lifestyle change and may seem restrictive to some people, being a climatarian sounds much more flexible and doable, and the term is also a good reminder of why you're making the lifestyle choice that you're making, which is keeping the environment in mind.

I also found this week’s reading really interesting and informative because the way in which we communicate climate change science is crucial. It directs people down a path that can alter their lifestyle to create change that is beneficial to them and for the environment. You also bring up a really good point about actions. Communicating through actions is one of the most effective ways of climate action because you’re actually proving to others that you are following through with what you say. Watching the video after the reading, Ken mentioned his experience being a vegan when in the same proximity as people who aren’t. He, along with the reading, made a really clear point about how to get people to understand certain things when it comes down to serious topics like climate change, that is to wait until they ask because that’s when you know that they are truly interested. The term “freegan” is really interesting because when being vegan there’s always a misconception about people who choose to be vegan. However, the term freegan really changes that because it allows people to understand that it’s just one being more consciously aware of their food choices - having the environment in mind when choosing to eat certain things, such as choosing to eat turkey over beef, etc.


<br><hr>
I agree with your comment; I think one of the biggest issues is that some people aren't educated well enough on this matter. It is also an issue when people argue that we must change our actions to benefit the planet, but have no convincing arguments. This reading does just this, it shows us how to be more effective at this. In terms of his experiences with his diet, I personally think this would be something a bit extreme for me. However, even wasting less food or cutting back meat a day or two is a huge help. Like you mentioned being a climatarian seems more possible for me to emulate and makes me a bit more hopeful about the situation. Whatever steps we take to help with the crisis, I'm sure will be helpful as any contribution is a good one.



<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. I definitely think the way you communicate with people is a huge part of how effective this complex problem of climate change will come across to someone, causing one to form a certain opinion about this issue. Educating people to better understand this issue is crucial and we must go about it in a cautious way. I loved how Professor Ken shared his experience of letting his friends understand the lifestyle he chose. I think going about it the way he did is great and can hopefully inspire others to do that too. I agree that becoming a climatarian sounds a lot more realistic in my eyes. I could definitely see myself going climatarian one day and would love to share my choice with others by communicating it in a specific way as shown in the reading.
<br><hr>

I also liked how this week’s reading is effective in how we can communicating and conveying the topic of climate change with each other. And I also found the comparison between public language to scientific language interesting. I felt that the use of words is very important and influential in communication. Such as what Ken mentions in the video of vagetarians vs. climatarians. I used to think that vegetarians are all doing this for their own health, but now, I learned the term "climatarian" that I know that many people are actually becoming a vegan to help with the climate crisis.

This week’s reading was something I never really thought about with association to the climate crisis. The importance of communication seemed so obvious. While reading, I felt like the ideas mentioned in the reading were common sense, but it was a good to refresh on the fundamentals of moving any audience. Communication is so simple, yet so significant that sometimes we tend to forget about it.
                 <br><br>

The character of Uncle Pete, who does not support anthropogenic climate change, is very applicable today. We all can relate to knowing an Uncle Pete in our personal lives. Many of Uncle Pete’s myths were realistic reasons that people do not believe in the climate crisis. Additionally, I thought the metaphors the author made with respect to the climate crisis were intriguing. The metaphor comparing climate change to check up at the doctors is very accurate. The author is right, Earth has a fever that will become more severe as time passes. It is interesting that people don’t question doctors and modern medicine, but they question climate scientists and global warming. It seems contradictory to support some scientists, but not all.
                 <br><br>

Lastly, I liked the communication methods Ken mentioned in his lecture video. At times, we find ourselves passionately talking about our interests in hope that it will influence our friends. However, it is doing just the opposite. I agree, I think it is in our best interest to subtly mention words such as “climatarian” and “freegan” in conversations when the right opportunity arises. These words spark the right questions and discussions about lifestyle choices without pushing it too much. Solving the climate crisis will not only take personal actions, political activism, but also effective communication from the public.

I was genuinely surprised by this week's reading as well, as I had never realized the importance of good, effective communication on the climate crisis/awareness about the climate crisis. The stress on clear, concise arguments repeated by trusted messengers seems so common-sense, but actually was something I had never thought about. I forgot how we talk to people impacts their understanding of our message and is the reason that phrases such as "our house is on fire" can become so globally spread. The various metaphors used, like the thermostat, are good for painting a picture to others about just how dangerous our inaction can be. 

                 <br><br>

Uncle Pete really hit home for me, as I have quite a few climate skeptics in my extended family. As the chapter debunked their arguments, I felt relieved to know there was a way to effectively get through these lies about climate change being fake. Even though I felt like Uncle Pete was more of a caricature than an actual human being, I can definitely see the suggested approaches being useful to climate activists. While these tactics and facts are good for distant family (maybe) and strangers, I found it very hard to visualize actually saying any of this to the people in my family. To me, it felt like an instruction book on how to ruin Thanksgiving.  
                 <br><br>


Combined with Ken's video, however, the lesson on communication has a whole new meaning. I liked the advice of not trying to talk anyone's ear off about anything, and rather letting people's curiosity lead them to find new information. I could absolutely see this working with my friends and family when asked about my food choices. I feel like, in this way, there is no possibility of an argument/bad feelings because someone has made the choice to ask you, and you are simply responding. I do think it's very weird that "vegan" has such a weird connotation when it is literally about your own diet? But when using different terms, I think the language becomes more accessible again, and isn't so aggressive. Either way, I really enjoyed that part of this curriculum is learning how to effectively communicate this issue to others, and I think it makes spreading information so much easier.


<br><Hr>
I was surprised by this week's reading as well. When it comes to climate change, nobody thinks about making an impact through communication. The first ideas that come to everyone's minds are cutting down on fossil fuel emissions and eating less meat. I am glad that this was our reading due to the fact that it made me think about climate change in a different way. It has also made me realize that effectively communicating about the climate crisis is one of the easiest ways to help the environment. 
                 <br><br>
I also agree that Uncle Pete is an extremely relevant character in today's society. The description of Uncle Pete was is extremely accurate representation of the great deal of people who do not believe in the climate change. I agree that many of the reasons that were listed in the text are actual reasons that deniers say in order to argue that the global temperature is not rising. 
                 <br><br>
I felt that the metaphors that were presented were interesting too. They gave me different perspective on the problem that we are facing and the solutions that go along with it. Carbon dioxide really is the steroids of our climate. The addition of too much carbon in the atmosphere has greatly increased the chances of natural disasters like wildfires. Anyone who lives/has lived in California has seen first hand that this is true. 
                 <br><br>
Ken's discussion about communications was also interesting to me. I enjoyed his idea about starting a conversation with the word "climatarian" rather than ending the conversation with "vegan". This is a clever way to spark conversation about climate change and hopefully more people can adopt it.

I agree with many points made my the the assigned material "Bending the curve: Climate Change Solutions" and Ken. I think that in order to communicate the climate crisis effectively, it's important that we don't shy away people by instantly labeling our food choices as "vegan" or "vegetarian". If we instead focused on the climate and spoke of ourselves as "climatarian", we would certainly spark more peoples' interests. I agree with the author that the climate change is a human issue because it involves changing human action in order to work towards the common goal of reducing C02 emissions and shutting down the beef industry hopefully. I'm glad that the reading taught me how to more effectively communicate the issue at hand. The last thing you want to do when talking about the climate is to make people uncomfortable or bring up your views in an inappropriate manner. I know how to talk to people who deny the climate change, and there is many of them.  We all know an "Uncle Pete" and now we know how to deal with them.

I enjoyed this reading because I felt that it adhered to its own advice about climate change science communication. It used clear messages, and it repeated focal points that were particularly important to understand. It was also from a reputable source and understood who the audience was: climate activists who didn't necessarily have a background in science, but did their research and were passionate about the topic. The book delivered this information accessibly and effectively; in my opinion, I could hand this to a middle schooler and expect them to understand it and be able to use its techniques to effectively communicate climate science to their classmates, or as we discussed at the start of the quarter, in an intergenerational manner when talking to their parents. I also like how they posed climate change as an ethical issue rather than an abstract one. I appreciate how Ken himself uses these techniques in his lectures, by repeating certain statistics and explaining science to us in simplified, quick ways, he helps us understand the climate crisis better. Many facts from our class are simple and easy to repeat, and we have been had them backed by numerous reputable sources (such as the IPCC and the writers of Project Drawdown, the most comprehensive climate change solution ever written) and thorough research. Just as important as having knowledge is the ability to communicate that knowledge effectively. For example, I would rather hire an undergraduate tutor who had lots of experience working with students one on one rather than hiring a PhD student who had never taught or tutored in their life. Similarly, in order to educate the world about the climate crisis, we must make sure we have effective and clear communicators who are trained to help people understand how important it is at the forefront of the movement.

I really enjoyed reading “Communicating Climate Change Science” because it did a great job listing the problems we are facing with climate change and the solutions. The first chapter was very important because it states that global warming is not a hoax and went on to list the facts that earth is warming. It then lists 12 points which state that global warming is from humans. The readings were very interesting because it explains ways you could talk to relatives or people who don't believe in climate change. I thought this was very cool because this problem happens so often and many people don't know how to handle the situation except to argue with them. This article gives ways on how to deal with those types of situations which could really impact different conversations whether it's with your father or to an entire class of students. I thought this reading was very easy to read and was kind of similar to a lecture because of all the lessons that were taught.

I agree, this reading was different and easier to read due to its format. They took their own advice in language and how they must keep things simple and memorable. I like how they implement the importance of knowing your audience and presenting the information in the way that your audience will understand. It helps your argument seem stronger and it shows them that you care.
                 <br><br>

Also touching on the story of Uncle Pete in the reading and Ken's video It just makes me think of all the uncle Petes that are my age and that I have known for a while. There are some people that I went to highschool actually and they have always been close minded about the climate crisis. They would argue and still do on social media that  ́ 'climate change' ' is not real. Or even if it is that it is the government controlling it and that us humans have no fault. I never really argued with them because I always thought that it was pointless due to their close minded views, yet after this reading it has given me some input on how to deal with Uncle Pete.

I felt the same way when reading the chapter in “Communicating Climate Change Science”. I often have the same struggles that you have when knowing exactly what to say to my friends and family and when to say it. By going through each section and reading about preparation, stories, metaphors, language, and solutions, I was able to understand how to communicate the importance of the climate crisis to people like “Uncle Pete”. I know that mostly all of us know an “Uncle Pete”, but coming from a very small and conservative town, I know a lot. I often have trouble trying to communicate issues like the climate crisis to them because I’ll always get shut down or ignored. After watching Ken’s video and reading this chapter, I feel a lot better on knowing how I can effectively talk about the climate crisis with the people around me. I really liked when Ken said (or referenced), “Before you can change the world, you need to change yourself,” because it helps me to know that my individual life choices are actually important to the climate crisis.


<br><hr>
Throughout the reading, “Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions,” I totally agree with you, I also realize the power of communication. Both reading and Ken’s video introduce the effects of persuasion and metaphors on climate crisis. In the first chapter of reading, it proves the real consequences of climate changing. Then in the second chapter, the author lists 12 points that proves climate crisis is mainly caused by the human’s actions. This reading reveals that good communication can encourage more people around you to protect the environment together. So, communication is very important that can promote the positive development of protecting our planet. I think it is the one of most interesting reading I read in this quarter and in the class.

I found this week's reading quite interesting as it informed us on how to communicate with others and how to effectively share our knowledge. In order to effectively communicate our knowledge to others we need to use preparation, stories, metaphors, language, and solution. We need to prepare and have solid evidence before beginning, and we can use anecdotes as a rhetorical device to keep our audience entertained as they learn. In the reading the author uses a fictional character, Uncle Pete, who does not accept climate change science. Uncle Pete represents those that are unwilling to learn and change, despite the evidence being there right in front of them. Unfortunately, there are too many Uncle Petes that are unwilling to accept that there are changes that are occurring with our climate, and that we need to alter our lifestyle and choices if we are going to stop this problem from getting any worse. Metaphors can be used to make climate science easier to understand for those that don't have a background in any science. Word choice is also very important as it sets the tone for the entire piece. In our very first reading, many of us came out discouraged because there was no solution and the entire piece was extremely pessimistic, so it is important to have a solution that can motivate the reader.
<br><Br>
I liked the idea of having a diet that isn't vegetarian or vegan, but rather has the climate in mind. As we learned a few weeks ago, you can have the same impact as eating a beef diet if the veggies you eat are flown in from other places, rather than being locally grown. If the veggies are being flown in they have the same carbon footprint as other meats because planes are the fastest way to release the most amount of carbon emissions into the atmosphere. So if your diet is based around being environmentally friendly you will choose meats that are better for the environment, and veggies that are locally grown.

You bring up a great point about using metaphors to keep the audience engaged. Metaphors also allow the audience to learn about the basics of climate change without feeling too overwhelmed by the information. Language is also a key part of communication. The commentary on sharing information through scientific journals and the public is very interesting, where scientists usually provide background information, details, and results about their research topic, the author suggests to instead discuss the bottom line, why it is important, and then provide the supporting details. To keep your audience engaged, stating the main point in the beginning is more effective than at the end. Furthermore, the author warns against using scientific jargon, which is critical to communicating to people who do not know a lot about climate change. A chart was also shown about scientific terms may be misinterpreted and also provides better word choices to convey your message. The example mentioned in the chapter is the term “positive-feedback,” where scientists describe it as a negative term, but the public interprets it as a positive term. He mentioned that positive feedback is a self-amplifying process, for example, the snow in the Arctic melts, revealing darker surfaces of the earth, those darker surfaces absorb more light, therefore, the Arctic’s warming increases. However, the public deem positive feedback as a job well done, or something deserving of praise. 
                 <br><br>
In regard to talking to friends or whoever may want to learn more about climate change, employing the communication skills presented in the chapter is crucial to have people hear the message you’re trying to convey. This is a skill I need to continue to practice. As a scientist, I find it difficult to not use scientific vernacular because I am surrounded by scientists who also use scientific vernacular. However, being a scientist is more than just communicating to your colleagues that are also specialized in that field. A good scientist can communicate to other scientists, but a great scientist can communicate to anyone, regardless of their level of knowledge.

I very much enjoyed reading the assigned material for this week: “Bending the curve: Climate Change Solutions” because it not only stated the solutions but explained them, this chapter presented them in a new way, that is debunking myths of climate change deniers. The first half of this course was dedicated to explaining the climate crisis and it’s causes, which was interesting but I personally enjoy this part of the course explaining the solutions. This chapter uses previous information to better educate it’s readers not to believe everything said about the climate crisis. Before reading this chapter I was not aware the “Climatarianism” existed and to be honest, I'm glad I didn’t. It is hard for me to even believe that some people in this world demonize environmentally friendly ways of thinking and living. We are living in a culture of consumerism and freedom is dictated by the lifestyle we are able to afford, like the cars we can buy, the amount of clothes we have, and how often we can travel. However, all these ways of thinking have massively contributed to the climate crisis and if we don’t change our way of thinking the consequences will threaten the lives of almost every person in the world.

I agree with you on the subject that I like how the course is taking a new path on how to communicate the climate crisis and to squash climate conspiracies. I like how the class is transitioning from showing us the horrors of climate change to now tell other about the impending doom and how we can do that. This article is a great tool to use to help reach out those who are much invested in the consumerist culture.

I really enjoyed this chapter because he reminded me of the damages that an increase in CO2 would do. It also taught me ways to communicate the climate change situation. I am a bio major so I understand that part of always trying to explain. Things with a lot of detail that could sound confusing to people because it’s so much information that is unclear. But after the example given about the doctor, I was convinced that we should speak climate change in the simplest terms. Even though I feel like I do not have an uncle peter, the examples used to help him understand seem very effective. There are a lot of people who do not believe in the science out there. Therefore, we can follow the example of uncle Pete to help promote change in people. We have to do this fast because the ocean temperatures are rising making oceans more acidic and causes dangers for water species. This is leading to the meltdown of ice which is also bad. As a whole this chapter serves as a useful teaching method.

I agree with you that the chapter mentions really good tips of how to effectively communicate about climate change.  I like the metaphor that you can't fix a medical problem with a bandage, and that there is risk involves in going to surgery. I like how the chapter gives us a lot of options, many tactics we can carry out. Similarly, Ken mentioned in this snippet that you don't have to be a vegan, but you can make freegans, climatarians choices. I has stopped eating beef, but I still eat other meats.

I liked how "Communicating Climate Change Science" was formatted and written using easy-to-understand language. I think that made Professor Somerville's ideas more effective and also proved his point about how communicating successfully requires using language that the audience can understand. I think that is the most important point he makes. When communicating to someone who disagrees with you, I believe you should simplify your arguments as much as you can, and only add detail when asked for it. Forcing facts onto someone who does not want to hear them won't get you anywhere.
                 <br><br>


In today’s political climate people in both parties tend to get really heated up when debating for what they believe in, and that always causes the opposing side to become more defensive and less likely to ever change their mind. In 2016, when I was a junior in high school, I noticed that the presidential election had caused an increase in political conversation. My school also consisted of a good mix of conservatives and liberals so I would always hear both sides of the debate. I’ll admit I was one of those people who hated everyone who disagreed with me. However, I noticed that one of my classmates who was famously conservative was also super popular among everyone, and almost all of his friends were very liberal, and I finally realized it was because he was respectful of everyone’s opinions, and overlooked their political views. That helped me learn that you could disagree on certain things, but you could still get along with everyone. I’m still passionate about what I believe in, but I no longer force anyone who has a different opinion to listen to me tell them why they are wrong, and that creates an amount of mutual respect which allows healthy debate and makes it more likely to help change a person’s views.

One of the things I never considered was the reason Uncle Pete was afraid that implementing laws in favor of a greener nation would limit his personal freedom. I liked the writer’s suggestion in how to deal with a person with such fears - by showing Uncle Pete that if governments chose not to take action to fight against climate change, then there would be a system worse than socialism running the world. Weak governments would fall apart, millions of refugees would be created, and countries like the US would have to dispatch emergency services and basically implement all laws that are implemented during wartime. I think that is a great way to paint a picture of what could go wrong, and how fighting for a better planet would never result in severely limited freedoms.

I thought the same thing as you when I was reading “Communicating Climate Change Science.” Professor Somerville emphasized talking about science in terms for the lay audience. Using the correct language is key to communicating with your audience, and I thought that he did a great job of reflecting his arguments in his own writing. This chapter was easy to read and follow, and all of his arguments were written in simple terms. I never got lost while reading, which allowed me to completely understand this reading.
                 <br><br>


I also loved Professor Somerville’s example with Uncle Pete. There are so many people in this world that have the same beliefs as Uncle Pete, which is why we aren’t making much progress with the climate crisis. This reading described ways to refute the common myths of skeptics. “Your policies and values and politics have a role to play in deciding which actions are best, but any rational policy begins by accepting the science.” Climate change is a very partisan issue in the US, when it should be based on science. There’s no scientific evidence denying climate change, so politics should not lead people astray from this fact.

<p>
Reading this article is quite like a fresh experience for me! Apart from all those facts that we have already been familiar with during this class, such as the 97% consensus, the greenhouse effect, and the refutes to skeptics, the article put up with a relatively new perspective: methods for effectively communicating climate change to vast audiences. The basic philosophy, according to the author prompted at the beginning, was to “use simple clear messages, repeated often, by a variety of trusted messengers.” Therefore, through the whole course of reading the passage, I literally feel no barrier to understand his words, sentences, or structures. Also, in the preparation part, he practiced his so-called “ don’t bury the lead” strategy, through which he strongly enumerated 12 solid facts regarding climate change. Those actually are the most important part of the passage in relation to part 2 of the article: Stories. In fact, after being exposed to these 12, there is no space for all “Uncle Petes” to argue. Everything can be addressed, and every hoax can be disclosed. In part 3, the metaphors comparing medical science and climate science are fair and lead me into consideration. Why people, at the start of something new, always tend to disbelieve? If it’s in the past regarding medical science history, excuses can be brought out such as people were ignorant to science. However, it’s 21st century now. Scientists are among the most respectful. Why people still try every effort to trust in themselves until proven wrong? Thus, after reading, a sad feeling aroused in my mind as seeing scientists try every means to convince the public of the truth.
                 <br><br>


The part I found most intriguing in Somerville's "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" was when he talked about the linguistic aspect of sharing information about the climate with the public. I never thought about how so many people can misunderstand words like "enhance" and "positive feedback" and associate positive connotations with them, no matter what kind of information is provided. Some of the most interesting words Somerville describes as having different meanings for scientists and the public are "manipulation," which means "illicit tampering" for the public and "scientific data processing" for scientists and "theory," which means "hunch or speculation" to the public and "scientific understanding" for scientists. Thus, according to the definitions for the public, if something has been manipulated in scientists' data and their research is partly based on theories, the scientists' claims seem to have very little credibility. This risk of misunderstanding that undermines credibility is why language is so important when conveying information about climate change in an accessible way. Choosing concise, easy-to-understand words rather than loaded language and scientific jargon allows the public to make more accurately informed choices and opinions.

The manner in which scientists explain and convey scientific data and results to the general public does have a significant impact on how the public reacts with the climate crisis. Therefore by using easy-to-understand words that a wide range of individuals can understand without translation or misunderstanding will help the public realize the severity of the climate change and how we have allowed it to get out of control. For that reason, scientists have to include the public when discussing the latest discoveries concerning the climate crisis because of the issue that affects every individual from all parts of the world. Especially the media reported in the United States have to do a better job when discussing climate change to properly educate the public.

This week’s reading is really interesting and different from all other reading materials we ever had before. As a reader, I am introduced to Uncle Pete, and the circumstances described in this chapter fit perfectly with what I have encountered. This week’s reading is super educational and inspiring. It provides us with practical communication skills that we can apply to our daily lives when we encounter other climate crisis denials or supporters. Besides what I have read in the reading, Ken also provides a really good way to advertise our green style of living. When we really want to convey our idea to others, lectures are useless, but we can make others curious. We can introduce academic terms to make our companions or friends more curious towards what we are expressing, and also we can just show them how we live and how we act under certain situations. After learning tons of practical solutions that we can apply to our daily lives, we are finally accessible to communication skills. Therefore, we are more professional to be adequate environmental activists in this way.

Hi, Xinmeng. After reading the chapter 8 of “Communicating Climate Change Science”, I do agree with your argument on preparation part. When talking about the climate change, scientists fall into a trap that they want to enumerate great evidence to persuade people that the climate change really occurs; however, the omit the fact that those great evidence which includes too much professional terminologies may well cut down the interest of the public. Instead, using “simple clear messages, repeated often, by a variety of trusted messengers” is an effective communicating way since the clear messages only include the key ingredients and concise, which will not cause the listeners feeling boring. Other than the preparation part, the so-called “Uncle Pete” in this chapter is the most impressive part for me. I highly believe most of us will surround at least one “uncle Pete”who is conservative, stubborn and highly skeptical about the climate change. They put forth that the so-called climate change and the following solutions raised by experts about climate change are intrigues planned by the government who want to control them, which is an absurd argument. The communication skills mentioned in chapter 8 are useful tools for us to utilize to persuade our uncle Pete.
                 <br><br>

Regarding Prof.Ken’s video, there is a great difference between using the words freegan and climatarian other the the words vegetarian and vegan. It is true one may feel obligated when others are trying to persuade him to be a vegetarian in that, in his minds, those persuasions is somewhat forced him to be a vegetarian, which may cause their abhorrence. In contrast, using the word climatarian may generate different result in that people are not familiar with the word. Therefore, they are willing to know more about the word. As that terminology becomes better understood, the majority will be willing to change their diet towards turkey rather than beef since they know that the beef will emit far more greenhouse gas comparing to the turkey.


<br><hr>
Xinmeng, I like that you brought up how Uncle Pete depicts situations you have actually encountered. I feel like when the audience ready about Uncle Pete each of them personify climate deniers and picture their own version of Uncle Pete in their head. This is a creative literary tactic that pulls the reader in to engage with the story being told. "Deciding to do nothing about climate change is like deciding not to have serious elective surgery,..." this sentence hit me hard because I actually have to have ACL reconstruction surgery during this upcoming spring break. My knee is no where near as important as climate change but I would not elect to skip this knee surgery and walk impaired for the rest of my life. In a way, when we turn the other cheek towards climate change, we are electing to live the rest of our lives on an impaired planet. We need to explain this to the uncle Petes of the world. The reading talks about how metaphors have been used to communicate the severity of climate change and I'd like to give an example. Rather than CO2 being the steroids of climate change I would like to say that the causes of climate change are a melting pot because several factors contribute to it and they all go hand in hand like a recipe for disaster.

I thought this week’s reading was the most engaging piece we’ve had all quarter. This is probably a biased opinion because I’m a Pre-Communication major, BUT I think it’s extremely crucial for us to learn how to effectively communicate the climate crisis in order to impact a broader audience (as opposed to an audience of intellectuals who are capable of grasping complicated scientific jargon). Anyway, it’s just nice not having to spend half your reading time Googling definitions to words.

                 <br><br>

Also, the key points that the author made (preparation, stories, metaphors, language, and solutions) were justifiable. The tone in which Somerville addressed his audience with (whom I would assume to be “ordinary” people who don’t typically spend hours on end researching and defending the climate crisis) was enough indication that he knows precisely how to educate people about climate science.
                 <br><br>


What I thought was most impactful was Somerville’s use of metaphors, such as the connection that he had between climate scientists and doctors by stating, “They [climate scientists] know a lot, so they want to say a lot. That’s a mistake... Instead, a wise doctor speaks to you in simple clear terms.” Imagine if you were sitting in your doctor’s office and they say to you, “You have nocturnal enuresis.” Wouldn’t it be easier if they said that you have a nocturnal bed-wetting problem? Simply put, it’s easier AND more productive to use Layman’s terms when communicating complex issues, like the climate crisis.
                 <br><br>


TLDR: Communicating effectively → more awareness → possible votes/climate activism → CHANGE!!!

I totally agree with you in regards to simple language making the best type of communication. When people don't understand the language being presented to them because it is too scientific and not ordinary words, they get confused and don't take what is being said to them as seriously as they should. When climate change communicators speak in simple and concise language, their audience has a better grasp of what is happening to the environment and will most likely agree with what is being said and what needs to be done.

                 <br><br>

 I think an interesting part of this chapter that I never thought of doing was engaging with the "Uncle Pete" that is in our own lives. I always believed that I shouldn't try to change people's mind about topics that they are so against because I didn't think I had it in me to convince them otherwise. But this way of thinking is completely wrong and reading this chapter helped me understand why. Planting little seeds of evidence in people's minds who don't believe in climate change may get them to think differently and do their own research. Many of these people may be using their own political affiliation with reasoning as to why they don't believe in climate change, which is wrong and can be fixed if you can communicate in simple terms to them.
                 <br><br>


Putting this into my own example, there are some readings from this class that I understood and grasped better than others. For example, the book titled, "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" was very difficult for me to understand because of the confusing language so I didn't grasp enough information and didn't pay too much attention while reading it. But, when I read "The Uninhabitable Earth" the language was simple and easy to understand for ordinary people, so I really understood and was frustrated with the situation because of the language.


<br><hr>
By giving factual information, the author invites us as the audience to accept justifiable evidence on climate change through providing interesting comparisons. For instance, humans burning coal, oil, & natural gases is a hundred times more harmful in comparisons to volcanoes which rarely erupt in the first place. Carbon Dioxide has been on a constant rise, now 45%, since the 1800’s. In fact, the author states that CO2 is the biggest current problem to the environment as the need to reduce global heat from trapping gas and particle emissions has reached a critical point. An effect of this is that the sea surface temperature has reached 80 degrees Fahrenheit. 
                 <br><br>

Diction is also a major factor that the author contributes to making this week’s readings stimulating as it also personally engaged me further to read the entire chapter. I agree when technical syntax is used, the public will naturally lose interest as a psychological response to the mind actively trying to associate itself with similarity. I really felt like the author gave us the opportunity to be open minded through defining certain terms like the kneeling curve while also using general words to relate to the audience.

I agree that this was a very engaging read, and also an easier read. Also, I totally agree that it is extremely important for us to be able to communicate the climate crisis. The reason for many problems in our world is an inability to communicate and understand others. On a topic like the climate crisis, which should be undebatable, it is even more essential to communicate. There are no facts to support the other side, so the whole argument is based off of an inability for the opposing side to understand and rid themselves of previous bias. Learning ways to communicate through this through Chapter 8 is very beneficial, and thats why I got so immersed in it. Also, as someone who likes debating topics with people, these points were very helpful and will definitely come in handy the next time someone tries to deny the climate crisis in front of me. 

                 <br><br>

The key points are very simple which allows for anyone to incorporate them into their arsenal of stopping climate deniers. Also through the use of an Uncle Pete, we were able to see a real world situation and understand how to work through it.

                 <br><br>

Also I think that simplifying the climate crisis is one of the best points I've heard on how to communicate it. It is true that when there is too much detail thrown at you, it can be hard to understand the main idea and what to do about it. I find myself simplifying many topics in my daily life in order to let people understand what I mean quicker, yet when I talk about the climate crisis, I have found myself going way too in detail, maybe because I think I sound smarter. It is important to take it simple and slow in order to have an understanding and mitigate the chances of a misunderstanding.
<br><hr>


Also when Ken says that he waits for people to ask him about his stances on topics before addressing them, I thought this was a super important part of this talk. Waiting for people to be ready for answers is super important because it shows they are in the right mindset to actually learn something.
                 <br><br>
I agree that this week’s reading was quite engaging and did a successful job of laying out the ideas behind communication when it comes to the climate crisis and making others aware of the issue. I agree that it is crucial for us to know how to effectively communicate, especially in application to how different generations may differ in their way of perceiving information, new ideas, and etc. This way, we are able to better understand how to reach a broader audience. Somerville’s doctor analogy was a great way of explaining that effective communication accommodates the average person and/or a specific audience.
                 <br><br>
Change begins with awareness. Awareness is made possible through clear and effective communication. The power we hold in our language is often underestimated and if done well, can be used for the good of our planet.

To resolve the issue of climate change, it is important to communicate with people in an effective way. Preparing well is the first step to communicating well. Preparation includes knowing general principles of communication and having access to valuable resources and acquiring an adequate knowledge of the science of climate change. It is essential to use simple clear messages, repeated often, by a variety of trusted messengers. Besides, stories are a wonderful way to engage an audience. Last, metaphors can be superb communication tools. A metaphor compares one thing to another thing, often in a way that brings out hidden similarities or reveals unexpected resemblances that can aid our understanding. Language is a critical aspect of all communication, written or oral, on every topic. To avoid the mistakes that climate scientists themselves often make is also crucial.
                 <br><br>

As far as I am concerned, confronting climate change is fundamentally a moral and ethical issue. Communication is indeed important. Different audiences require different approaches. There are several factors that shape science communication, such as prior knowledge, ability to understand numeric data, and way of interpreting new information. Emotions provide simple, and often highly adaptive, shortcuts for assessing new information. There are also different ways of presenting information. Engagement tends to be more effective than content delivery.
                 <br><br>

All in all, in science communication, how you say it is often as important as what you say.




</p><hr>


<p>
I have often identified as a contrarian, but reading this chapter on effective climate communication makes me realize the worst aspects of skepticism coming alive in the fictional, but all too real character 'Uncle Pete'. Uncle Pete is a contrarian for its own sake. To be exact, he is a contrarian when it's easy. It's easy to insist that we shouldn't change our lifestyles, and to repeat the same simple arguments against climate science again and again. On the other hand, many people who understand climate science and act in such a way that aids the climate do not understand how to communicate it. They say there's a scientific consensus, but then often go into far greater detail than that. Ironically, the more detail you go into, the less your arguments will penetrate to the average person, especially an 'Uncle Pete'. 

                 <br><br>

Instead, we have to learn to trust climate science in the same way we trust medical science. I felt the medical science comparisons were the most helpful in the articles. Large climate trends are predictable, unlike the day-to-day weather. One's health on a day-to-day basis is hard to predict, but it's easy to show that you'll have a substantially shorter life if you smoke. We have to distill current climate knowledge into a series of plain statements. These statements may lose the nuances of the science, but a doctor does not explain all the underlying mechanisms of the drug they prescribe, they merely say what it'll help with. Politicians and the public at large need to learn to trust climate scientists with the health of the climate in the same way most people trust doctors with their personal health. Climate science needs to be understood in familiar terms, in imperial units in the US as the chapter notes, but perhaps in other commonly used measurements that help exemplify the scale of the problem at hand. For example, how a couple degrees fever can be crippling, just like how it is in the case of 'global warming', or describing distances of the rainforest getting destroyed in terms of 'football fields', or in comparison to the size of the continental US. These terms take the abstractions and jargon of climate science and make them real and understandable. This, in addition to the specific language the article mentions, can make a huge difference in how the general population comes to understand climate science.

Communication between your friends and family sometimes will help the environment. Some people do not care about the climate or they do not think the condition of our environment is as sever as scientists claim. Also, they may do not know how to help our environment efficiently. They know a little with being vegan or reducing consumption. They even do not know the damage on our environment caused by taking planes. So we should communicate with out family and friends in order to provide information about protecting environment. Sometimes, people would not like to talk about these. But I think if we can keep trying to communicate with family and friends, we will see the good results of our efforts.

I think this video is very relieving for some people because it makes every single person taking this class feel like they can make a difference and/or they have some impact on the climate crisis situation. Like you said, even something as small as just communicating with friends or family about how maybe being a "freegan" or even a vegan is something that can positively benefit the environment. On that note, I think what you talked about in this video takes a lot of weight off our shoulders thinking that we have to make these drastic changes to our diet when really its just considering not eating meat in a few meals. I also really like what you said in that it is important that people like us, after having taken a college-level environmental studies class, that we make sure to refute claims that deny climate change.

I completely agree with Somerville’s advice on how to talk to “Uncle Pete” about the climate crisis as well as with friends and family who want to take action about the climate crisis but do not know how to do it. I think the main argument I agree with is to be careful in the use of jargon when discussing the climate crisis with others as it causes misinterpretation of information. Many arguments that anti-climatists have against climate change are a few mistakes that climate scientists have had. We shouldn’t give them any easier way of trying to discredit climate scientists as the arguments scientists have are valid but just not being communicated as concise and effectively as they should. I personally make the same mistakes when I speak to my friends and family about the issues we see in our world today because of climate change and notice as I have to explain more on some topics because our understanding and knowledge of concepts are not the same. The science, the data, the explanations–– they are all there. Communication between the science community and the general public is crucial for changes to happen. Lack of communication, as it happened for the consumption of cigarettes and its negative impacts, is not something that should be repeated in time, especially with climate change.
                 <br><br>
In addition, using metaphors to help others understand the science of what is happening on our planet is just as important. It is one thing to tell someone why they should or should not do something, but personally, I know that if I do not completely understand why I should or shouldn’t do something, I’ll probably end up doing the complete opposite. I wouldn’t know what is happening or what the implications of my actions would mean or cause in the long run. Climate change is something that we need to talk about more, but if we are not talking about it in the right way where a conversation can be held between two parties, changes in action can be prolonged longer than it should.

I completely agree Wirth your statement, I feel as though Somerville did an effective job at communicating the climate crisis to characters like Uncle Pete, and brings up very good points regarding the whole situation. One of my main concerns as well was communicating climate change when using jargon because to my surprise many people get certain terms mixed up. For instance I was asked about my classes by my older brother and I was talking to him about English 23, and I was using "science terms" communicating about the climate crisis, and he didn't understand the severity of the situation. It wasn't until half way through the conversation I realized he didn't understand what I meant. I thought he would respond in a more negative way regarding the concern of the climate, but his response was more neutral. When I began taking this class the beginning of the semester I was commenting to my mom on the phone about the climate issue, and I was extremely shocked by her response. I told her how climate change is a result from human action and she told me that I was wrong and didn't believe in climate change. Mind you, she is 45, I would expect this response if she was a bit older, we ended up arguing through the phone about this issue for a good 5 minutes or so. I found it extremely difficult to educate her on this issue without being so harsh and critical on her lack of education regarding this situation, however, her stubbornness just made the conversation more infuriating for me. The way Somerville lays it all out for his audience makes for an effective conversation.

I agree with Ken when he says once you tell someone you are vegan the conversation will just end and they just assume that you are vegan just for the dietary benefit. They don’t realize the other huge benefits for the environment. Although I am not vegan myself I completely support and admire people who are. Like the reading said though, it is very important to know what you are talking bout and to make sure your are not saying too much when discussing with someone. You can feel very passionate and strong about something and you might say a lot about a subject which could be off putting to others. It is also important to have correct information as well because you could rub into someone like an Uncle Pete who thinks they know what they are talking about but really don’t. 
                 <br><br>

Along with Ken’s video I liked how he included ways people help or can start to help the world around them by making better choices such as being freegans or climatarians. Many are all for helping the environment but haven’t really made any lifestyle changes in order to help. These 2 ideas are great ways for others to start participating in helping without making drastic changes to their lifestyle such as being vegan. All it requires them to do is to make better choices such as choosing turkey over beef.

I enjoyed this week’s reading a lot. It was very clear and concise on how we can effectively communicate to others the effects of climate change. I appreciate that the authors practice what they preach and were able to write something that is very easy to understand. I feel like many middle schoolers could read this text without any problem.
                  <br><br>

A few of the pointers in this chapter were fairly new to me. For example, I didn’t know how much of an impact language can have. It made sense after I read the section that for those who don’t read a lot of academic or scientific papers, the language used can hold a negative connotation, sound alarmist, or sound very passive. Looking at the chart that they provided, it was clear how someone can mistake the meaning of the whole text based on the word choice.
                  <br><br>

Another section that surprised me was the section on metaphors. It didn’t hit me until I read the section that metaphors can exponentially simplify a concept, by simply comparing it to another thing. Some of the examples given in the section used simple language and easy to understand the context to produce a metaphor that is an accurate representation of what exactly is happening. I believe this might be helpful for people who speak a different language other than English because the issue can easily be translated sans the scientific jargon.
                  <br><br>

Overall I think that this text is an excellent tool for anyone that wants to spread awareness about the climate crises and turn it back into a bipartisan issue instead of what many believe is a radical left issue.

I agree with you. The main thing I got from this video were the brilliant ways to communicate ones opinion on climate change. I think putting things scientifically and by using metaphors and such are great ways to create reality in opinions.


<br><hr>

I too enjoyed how concise and clear this weeks reading was and I agree the author truly does practice what he to she preaches. I think that this was exemplified by the use of clear word choice rather than using complex jargon that can be often misinterpreted. 
                  <br><br>

My favorite part of the reading was the metaphors. I never really thought about how useful a metaphor could be in order to convey an idea like climate change. My favorite ones had to be the analogy to baseball steroid use and medical advise from doctors. The doctor one especially stood out to me and was really mind opening. I have never looked at any of this material in that way. However, now that I think about it this metaphor is very accurate. Climate scientists are just like our normal doctors, they just advise us about the health of our planet instead of our bodies. It is up to us as a society to take this advice and do the "surgery" even though there will be risks because if we do not the "disease could be life threatening." 
                  <br><br>

I want to leave off with my favorite quote from the reading because I think that this passage is very important and is really accurate especially today, when so many people are trying to figure out what this whole climate crisis really is about. 
                    <br><br>

“Many people, when attempting to communicate complex subjects, typically fail to craft simple, clear messages and repeat them often. In- stead, they overdo the level of detail, so people have difficulty sorting out what is most important. In short, the more you say, the less they hear. Climate scientists often fall into this trap when trying to explain what they have learned to the broad public. They know a lot, so they want to say a lot. That’s a mistake. Think about the experts in various fields whom you may know, such as your doctor. He or she has spent many years learning a great deal about medical science, but only a very foolish doctor would try to tell you everything relevant to your health that medical science has discovered. Instead, a wise doctor speaks to you in simple clear terms.”




<br><hr>
Keerthana, I really appreciated many of the points in your response. Specifically, using metaphors is vital in helping simplify complex or dense information into a form that resonates closely with others. I think people often overlook this when discussing sensitive topics because it is fairly difficult to equate it to one another. However, if done well, then it can have significant effects on readers from older generations, as well as younger generations. All of these tools work as one to achieve a greater effect, which is saving our planet from the climate crisis.

After reading chapter 8 from “Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions,” I thought it was so great how different specialists were able to come together to formulate the system of communicating. They were able to create a systematic way of communicating about climate change. Even people like set-in-his-ways-Uncle-Pete are bound to have a better chance at becoming more educated about climate change. Uncle Pete is a character, based on fact, who argues against climate change using false information they have heard or read and just plain ignorance. Because there are so many people like Uncle Pete, we need better ways to communicate to the public. The new guidelines for communication can help more people find the will power to reduce their carbon footprint. We need to get past the political barriers and educate more peope into action.After reading chapter 8 from “Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions,” I thought it was so great how different specialists were able to come together to formulate the system of communicating.

I agree, I also thought that it was great. This text really puts the tools for effective communication right in our hands, which is so important; education is an extremely powerful and transformative tool, and being able to make educators is a great way to achieve change. Bringing up Uncle Pete I thought was very helpful as well, as it practices climate apologetics; however, I wonder how effective  it would be in practice. From the climate skeptics I've met in my lifetime, I've found that many of them have already heard the facts. They've been through the numbers and the science, but the fact that they still just don't want to believe in climate change prevents them from really listening. It's true that many of the skeptics out there are likely skeptics because of a lack of education, but there are many that have had educational opportunities but still choose to not believe in it because it goes against their political agenda or something likewise. How do we find ways to communicate to the people that simply just don't want to listen? While this text did provide some good techniques that I feel have better prepared me to address communication in the future, I still feel that in a situation like this I would still be lacking.

The reading discusses how important preparation is. In fact, the text says that preparing well is the first step to communicating well. Since we all might have a different idea of preparation in our heads, the reading does a good job at clearly defining it in this context. Preparation is knowing general principles for communication and having access to valuable resources. In addition, preparation in relation to climate change, also includes acquiring adequate knowledge of the science of climate change. When it comes to climate science communication, it is important to use simple clear messages, repeated often, and by a variety of trusted messengers. The reading explains that the “more you say, the less they hear.” This whole idea of talking simpler when discussing the climate change issue with others reminded me of a free response ID question during a midterm. At times we might feel like we studied so much that we know so much detail about the concepts that we feel the need to write as much about the material as possible when in reality we might be wasting our time on the question because in order to get full credit we could have answered the question with less detail and more direct. This connection aside, trusted messengers also play a huge role in this climate science communication. For instance, trusted messengers can motivate people to bring about change. Some of these messengers have a strong credibility with specific groups of people. For example, I would think that if there was a course taught about Chicanx studies that the professor would be looked at as a trusted messenger more than others if they were Chicanx. Other than being a trusted messenger, if a messenger wanted to improve their communication skills and really grab people’s attention, they could consider their audience. For instance, you would not give the same speech to those who already believe in climate change as those who think it is a hoax. Something that can help engage one’s audience is stories and metaphors. For example, a well known metaphor in the science community is that CO2 is the steroids of our climate. On top of knowing your audience, you must also know yourself, which means knowing your strengths and weaknesses as a communicator. When spreading a message about anything, knowing your subject matter is crucial. However, this does not mean you need to know everything. A nice thing that this reading brings to people’s attention is that you can’t possibly know everything, so if you don’t know the answer, just say so, don’t try and guess. Facts are critical when talking to others about climate change, or any subject for that matter, and once people question your facts, they start to question your credibility as well. Thus, it is just better to be straight up with people about what you know and what you don’t know.
                      <br><br>
  It’s important to remember that climate change is not just a dealing with science, but it’s also a moral and ethical issue. This means that we must think of what we owe future generations and what we owe to the natural world. Personally, I feel this civic duty to do as much as I can in order to ensure that my grandchildren have a world left to live in, that the planet has a future longer than is being discussed right now. When it comes to the natural world, I would feel this guilt if we destroyed something that was here long before us and realistically would be here long after us. It’s clear that we are the problem to this climate crisis, even the IPCC mentions how we are to blame in their 12 points. IPCC states that our planet is warming and we are responsible, and unfortunately the warming has not stopped. Another point addressed by the IPCC is how the heat is mainly in the sea, with over 90% of the heat added to the climate being in the oceans. It is no wonder that sea levels are rising globally and why the ice is melting. However, when the CO2 is absorbed by the oceans this also makes the oceans more acidic. I was completely baffled by the IPCC’s eighth point, that CO2 amounts in the atmosphere are about 45% higher than in the 1800s due to human actions. It’s crazy to me that some people have the audacity to state that humans aren’t causing this rapid rate of climate change, yet to them volcanoes are. Fortunately this myth of volcanoes being the reason for the climate crisis can be debunked with data and science. Measurements show that human activities, mainly burning coal, oil, and natural gas, produce about 100 times more CO2 than volcanoes do. Some people who believe climate change to be a hoax think that since we can barely predict the weather a week in advance that it is impossible to predict the climate temperatures decades in advance. However, these people fail to realize that it is easier to predict climate than the weather because climate predictions use statistics and patterns. Some climate change deniers think that climate change is just one more excuse for the authority of the state to control the lives of citizens. These people just assume the problem will solve itself, that we should do nothing because “if you let people keep more of their money, they will invest it in the future.” However, if we do nothing, vast numbers of people will become refugees for environmental purposes. It’s important to note that wealthy and powerful countries like the US will have their governments coping with severe climate change by acting forcefully. These forceful actions might include using emergency powers as in wartime, so that we can preserve order and minimize chaos and damage. As a result, the government would have more control over the lives of the citizens. Quite frankly it’s extremely ironic how climate change deniers fear is the government having more control over their lives, but if they do nothing about the issue completely, their fear will surely become a reality. I still find it astonishing how people who typically do not dare challenge the science of something, yet when it comes to the idea of climate change, people all of a sudden have a problem with the scientific facts. Climate scientists are component, honest, and here only to advise, so why do people find the need to challenge every statement the climate scientists claim?

Reading chapter 8 of “Communicating Climate Change Science” was very simple and easy to understand which I liked because this means that more people would be able to read it and also learn how to communicate with others without immediately shutting down the conversation. I also enjoyed and found very helpful how they spoke to the fictional character “Uncle Pete”. They would bring up a very popular argument against the climate crisis and refute it in a way that wasn't aggressive but instead very matter of fact which is very helpful for most of us who have met an Uncle Pete in our lives and didn't know how to change their mind or even approach the situation. I could also understand when Ken said that when he mentioned that he was vegan to others that would immediately halt any conversation, in my experience most of the time people immediately stop talking is because they expect to be coerced into a vegan lifestyle and they perhaps go into the defensive because they don't want to be told what to do or that how they are living their lives may be hurting others.

I agree with you. The author writes this book in a novel and easy way which allows readers to understand environmental issues simply, and it is more interesting and easier to let the audience believe the authenticity of global warming. In addition, the part of refuting other arguments also catches readers’ eyes. Honestly, it is very worth reading.
                      <br><br>
Before watching Ken's video, I simply think that we can solve the climate crisis by telling others the truth of environmental problems and solutions directly. But I have never stood in others’ shoes and think about their perspectives. True, it’s easy to be unhappy when people imposed their ideas on others. Ken's lecture not only teaches me knowledge, but also help me understand the communication skills between people. It's really wonderful.

This week's reading about communication was very interesting, the fact that it was divided into 4 sections was even more helpful. In each section there were interesting points made. In the first; preparation, scientists have a complex way of communicating their findings and it's hard for regular everyday people to know what they're trying to say. Climate scientists have to know who they're target audience are and how they will word their findings for people to understand. The second section was about stories. I feel like this one was the most important because it makes people consider what's being said more. One of the things mentioned also really caught my attention. “We have the thermostat that controls the temperature of future generations.”, literally it is self explanatory, we have the ability to change the temperature of the climate for future generations to come and it is literally very important for people to know. The metaphors part I found not so good, because of the fact that metaphors can be translated differently to people. Like he gave an example of how one of the words that mean something positive for all other people, is actually something negative for climate scientists. The mention of how people “solve” the climate problem was also interesting because I used to think like that. The use of an AC would solve the heat problem, I never thought about what was happening outside just focused on why the inside was hot and trying to make it not feel like that anymore. Thinking about it now, we are actually contributing more CO2 using ACs. 
Regarding Kens video, the change of vegan to freegan and vegetarians to climatarian really make a difference when talking to people. However since the word vegan is more widely known in our age groups the conversations when mentioning the word vegan, aren't so awkward anymore. Thinking about it the general public though I can see how these words would cause awkward silence, so the use of the new words would be very helpful in making people more conscious. These words are like less harsher, Ken said that the mention of vegan makes people uncomfortable because they feel obligated to not eat meat in front of a vegan. This can be true and the use of the new words would really make people become more conscious and not feel forced to choose something they don't want to eat just because they're eating with a non-animal product eater.

I agree with you that most people can hardly make any major changes at the macro level such as the national energy policy. But everyone can start with clothing, food and shelter to fight global warming. From the data of economic industries, the largest source of global greenhouse gas emissions is electric heating supply, accounting for 25%, followed by agriculture, forestry and other land use methods, accounting for 24%, which is slightly lower than electric heating supply. In addition to proactively choosing clean and environmentally friendly energy sources and economizing on usage, we can also choose our “food” approach to reduce our personal carbon footprint. Similarly, many people cannot decide how the land is used and what is planted, but everyone can completely decide what they want and don't need at their table. We can choose to eat less meat and dairy products, and eat more fruits and vegetables; try to buy local produce and seasonal fruits and vegetables. Because meat and dairy products consume far more energy during production and transportation than vegetables and fruits. I believe that when more and more of these choices are gathered together, they will converge into a force of change-change the world with the power of consumption.
<br><hr>
I agree with your comment, Yvette! First, I share the same opinion concerning the usage of metaphors; I also think they can be problematic in the sense that people do interpret them in their own way and can change up the intended message. I had the same experience you had with "solving" the climate problem and ACs! I really believed owning an AC would solve the climate crisis of excessive heat. I REALLY saw that as the solution because it was easy and effortless and it was a fix. I didn't see the whole picture as I do now. I also agree with your comment on our generation being more open to the conversation of veganism but still could use the aid of other terms. My housemate from back home actually brings it up quite often, making many look into what they eat more and more. Over here, it is looked with interest. But when the topic is brought up between our friends from back home, they do not press the conversation or ask many questions. Excessive talk on the subject actually hindered her message with them. I actually really like the term climatarian and its meaning, because I feel like they would have found that more interesting to ask about because it was something new and different. Language is a powerful tool for making change. The term climatarian I think enables a change that can be more compatible to a wider scale because it holds no limits, but rather focuses on choosing better alternatives with having the freedom to still eat what they want.

After reading Chapter 8, I learned that communication is one of the important ways to end the climate crisis. We need to understand the gasification crisis carefully before we can communicate with the people around us. Otherwise, I will finish this topic in advance because of my lack of knowledge. We can't underestimate the power of language. We can skillfully stimulate the interest of our friends through communication skills, and let them discuss this problem with you. Then through different examples to describe their own views on this matter and solutions, so as to promote everyone to think about this problem together. So communication is a very important thing. It can stimulate people's interest in a thing, or change a person's view of a thing. The key is how to make people understand and accept what you say.

This week’s reading also taught me the importance of communication. One quote from the reading that stuck out to me was “Use simple clear messages, repeated often, by a variety of trusted messenger.” This means to repeat simple messages, coming from different reliable sources. Those with knowledge need to understand that they are the ones with all of the knowledge on the subject. It would not be effective to tell someone with no knowledge complex data and concepts that are difficult to comprehend. Another example of learning how to communicate is the situation that Ken, himself, is in. He does not shove the benefits of being a vegan down people’s throats. He waits for people to come up to him with questions. He understands that shoving information down people’s throats will make them less likely to consider the environment when they eat.

I agree with you. Communication is a very important method to solve the problem. I am surprised about the five sections of communication. I haven't noticed the skill of communication before. I think the fifth section is very essential in solving the climate crisis. It is true that if we always provide a helpless attitude to others, it will make others think their effort to solve the climate crisis is useless, which will make less people pay attention to the problem. We should emphasize the severe situation of the climate crisis and the emergence to act. It is essential to keep optimism and illustrate the reason. And, it is better to talk about some methods to help the climate crisis. In addition, the preparation is also important. With clear background information, others can understand the issue better and have their own thought. We can project our thought on others. Maybe others can find some novel ways to approach the climate crisis.

Hi Ben, I completely agree with you about the art of language. After reading the article and watching the video, I have the same thought as yours. Throughout this course, I have been saying that we must all persuade people surrounding us to change our lifestyles. However, it’s all about doing, not saying. This video has taught me a lot on the strategy of communication; it inspires me to share my opinions indirectly. Just like the example which Ken has shared with us, simply responding to others with a word answer is not enough to motivate them to act. Instead, we allure others to question us and provide them a plausible alternative. To add on, I have learned the difference between being a vegetarian and freegan. For most people, being a vegetarian might seem too extreme as we are unable to completely forgo eating meat. In this case, freeganism is a better option. Rather than forgoing meat, we can still reduce our carbon footprint by choosing an option that releases fewer greenhouse gases.

Something that stood out to me after reading this was when Uncle pete's myths came up and he mentions how that “Changes in the sun cause climate change.” I found this really funny because of course the people that say this are just trying to blame all of their problems on something else. Something that really upsets me is that when the U.S. gets hit hard because of climate change, the rich will be the first to evacuate the country. I find that the people who disagree with climate change will be the first to blame other things than their own actions and would most likely be the first to leave the places that get hit the most. Why don’t these people ever take responsibility for their actions? Is all the money they make from fossil industries worth more than their own lives and the lives of their future grandkids? To me it seems that it is and it sucks that the people with the most money are not willing to help more than the people who don't have as much. The changes to the climate are not anyones elses faults than the people who live on this earth. We have all one way or the other participated in the emission of greenhouse gases, its not a matter of who will take action before it's too late.

Hi Jaime! I agree with you about how some people refuse to believe that they can be at fault for contributing to climate change. There can always be some sort of excuse or justification or someone else is to blame. The world leader seem only care about profit. How can they continue making profit off of a world that is heating up. Soon enough, the earth will be destroyed from natural disasters, a pandemic will wreak havoc, and the atmosphere will raise another 2 degrees celsius. We all need to pull our weight to do better and collectively to save the earth.

I think the most important part of both "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" and Ken's lecture is the importance of language. 
                      <br><br>


One excerpt from Sommerville is, "there is an insidious trap involving common everyday terms that are not
                      <br><br>
jargon, and that many people use, but that scientists use to mean something completely different from what everybody else means. There are hundreds of such terms, and they should be avoided by anyone wishing to communicate climate change science effectively."  This is important when it comes to climate change because we need to make sure we know what we are talking about.  Not only do we need to be weary of using scientific jargon, we also need to make sure everyone agrees on the definition of words we are talking about.  Without proper use of language, climate change doubters can wield your language against your points, just to win an argument, even if they know what you are saying.
                      <br><br>


Language is also important for Ken, except in a different manner.  He explains how changing our language, such as saying, "Im Vegan" to "Im Freegan"  sparks conversation and allows us to lower people's defenses.  Having concise and compassionate language leads to building bridges and connections.  Unfortunately,  we generally use obtuse and abrasive language when we are passionate about a subject.  While we should not stifle our energy about climate change, we do need to think about how we communicate our ideas and beliefs effectively.

I enjoyed how detailed the this was, and various topics covered are helpful to people with different lifestyles.
                      <br><br>
This reading was definitely different from the usual readings for the class. It was more of an informative list, and I really appreciate the simplistic format of the piece.Maintaining livestock requires an abundance of resources, from water, feed, and land. Not only is it expensive to maintain, but the treatment practices of these animals are not regulated. People treat the animals very poorly, and abuse isn't uncommon in the meat industry.
                      <br><br>
Food is a fundamental aspect of our lives, and we simply cannot live without constantly fueling ourselves. When Ken asks if we are the "architects" of the future, I began to question what I am doing to help solve the climate crisis. I believe that switching to a plant based diet is an important step towards the right direction. I began eating vegetarian once or twice a week, and hopefully eat more plant based meals.
                      <br><br>
I believe that taking small steps are more important than taking drastic and unsustainable lifestyle changes.

I think what this week’s reading and video really emphasized is that delivery is everything. Forcing people to change and just accept new lifestyles is unrealistic and is not the way to get them on our side. (even though there shouldn’t be sides in the first place, but you know what I mean). I think the reason why lots of people are opposed to veganism is because of one vegan ruining it for them all, acting like they are superior as Ken mentioned. The frustrating part is that 9 out of 10 vegans are not this way, but those 10% ruin the real meaning behind the dietary choice.
                      <br><br>

I of course knew about veganism before coming to college, but never cared to research it because all I heard was the stereotypical annoying vegan girl that won’t shut up about it. The delivery clearly ruined it for me, initially at least. This all changed when I came to college, thanks to my roommate. She has been vegan for six years, and even though I ate lunch and dinner with her every day, I did not know she was vegan for an entire month. This is because she didn’t shove it in our faces and make it seem like she was any better than us for the decision she made. Instead, when we found out (and were shocked because how did we have no idea for so long), she didn’t make it a big deal and just explained her reasoning behind it. Her reason was initially for animal rights, but later became passionate about the environment and that was an extra bonus. Like I said, the delivery was everything. We were so curious about it and she actually helped us eat a vegan meal that night for dinner. I would have been lost trying to feed myself vegan, but because she explained what exactly I can and cannot eat, and even showed me where it all is in the dining hall, I am now a pro at it! Sometimes we eat vegan with her to support and she has even gotten many of us off of meat products almost fully. She went about it in the least pushy, judgmental way and because of that her actions gradually rubbed off on us; we often find ourselves eating what she eats and unintentionally decreasing our dietary carbon footprint. 
                      <br><br>

Delivery is everything in all things climate change, not just veganism. It is everything with decreasing flights, driving, fracking, consumerism, house sizes, food waste, and anything else that emits far too many greenhouse gases. We must be clear and confident when communicating, but not aggressive or judgmental. Let others make the choice for themselves, but educate them and give them the initial “unpushy push”.

Thank you for saying that 9/10 vegans are not pushy and act superior!! I definitely strive to be the least pushy vegan because as you said, it’s all about the delivery. I really don’t want to scare anyone away from veganism because that obviously defeats the purpose. I’ve had friends say the same thing to me about not even knowing I’m vegan because it doesn’t need to be my personality trait. It’s nice because I actually get really good responses once people do find out I’m vegan. They’re often interested and want to try vegan food/alternatives. I think for me it’s kind of like leading by example rather than just talking about it. Last quarter my roommates and I had a 100% vegan Friendsgiving so it really does help to just be nice about veganism and the climate crisis in general. 

                      <br><br>

I like your point about giving an “unpushy push” because all we have to do during communication about such topics is to be clear and factual to give the other side a foundation to build and think upon.
<br><hr>
That's so cool that you were able to have an all vegan Friendsgiving. Making something climate change friendly and also super fun is the perfect combination. And you are setting a great example for your friends, whose actions are bound to change due to hanging around you. People naturally follow others around them, and you are definitely taking advantage of that. I love how you said that veganism doesn't have to be your personality trait, because although it is a great decision to make, I think people read into it way too much. I don't think people need to be labeled as another vegan when they're just trying to do their part in solving the climate crisis.  Your Friendsgiving was the perfect "unpushy push" and is proof that actions are a better delivery than talking about it nonstop when people don't want to hear it.

I found the reading by Somerville very enlightening because I recently have had a chat with an Uncle Pete about climate change, aka my dad. My mom has always spoken to me growing up about how we must preserve our environment because climate change, but my dad has never believed that it was actually a thing and only a hoax. I was recently on the phone with him when he asked me about my classes, and when I mentioned Ken's class, he asked me what type of stuff I was learning. I told him about all we have learned and his only response was that it sounded very one sided and didn't really mentioned the side denying climate change. I told him we looked at what the other side had to say, but I mentioned that it is irrefutable that the planet is warming faster than it has ever done before and that humans are causing it. This one comment led to a conversation that lasted about 3 hours of us going back and forth. Me claiming we as a society need to get our daily habits in order as well as getting the government to support green lifestyles while he argued we can't and don't have to do anything because it is not our fault that the earth is warming and it is a natural cycle that we are in.
                      <br><br>


This conversation did nothing to sway him, and if anything, it strengthened his resolve. This is why I found the reading interesting because it is true that we cannot do anything to teach people and help them change their ways if they are not willing to listen.  I believe all the tools Somerville mentioned are valuable because communication is key to get any point across. People who deny climate change are usually scared and don't know where to start, so they want to ignore the facts or believe others who say climate change isn't real even if they have no credibility. It is hard for people to understand something that has been oversimplified for years, and it is even harder for people to admit they are wrong, and it is the hardest for people to lose money and have their livelihoods at risk. Because of these common fears that people who don't believe in climate change have, I found it very important that solutions were key to communicating the idea of the climate crisis. As Somerville said, no one wants to be left hopeless, so be offering solutions to the problems and safty nets so peoples lives don't fall apart, people are more likely to get on board. I also like how it was pointed out that each change doesn't even need to be a drastic first jump, instead tiny changes, one at a time are enough, but it still needs to start soon.

Encouraging people to make adjustments in there life in accordance to phenomena they deny is certainly a big challenge. It's very paradoxical, especially considering the sense of urgency that was instilled within me after reading some of the earlier readings. Considering Ken's advocation for hasty, aggressive change to cultural norms and then now hearing him speak of a more passive approach to climate change indeed brings me back to wondering if our predicament is really solvable. Fake news has given many a sense of distrust in the things we hear which I believe will be ultimately detrimental to our efforts. However, I also believe that we should still act as if everyone else were doing the necessary things to reduce one's own climate footprint.  That is, we act with proactive serendipity.

The challenge of communicating climate change is one that I have been thinking about and struggling with a lot. However, I think communicating through action and activism, while taking the steps outlined in chapter 8 of Bending the Curve, is a very effective method. I have recently become more involved with different grassroots organizing efforts. As a result, I have received a lot of questions from my family, friends, coworkers, etc. about why I am participating in certain actions or just general details around certain events. This has created a huge opportunity to communicate why these issues are important, not only to me, but why they should care about them as well. It has created a space where their curiosity leads them to inquire about climate change. Since they are the initiators of the conversation, they are more receptive to the information I present. It’s crucial to make sure your audience is receptive to the conversation because no one likes to feel like others’ values and beliefs are being imposed on them, as Ken points out in the vegan example.

I think that it is extremely important to consider your audience when communicating about the climate crisis. The main problem I had in understanding the climate crisis was when I would read academic articles-- the academic jargon made it too difficult for me to follow along. I understand that this is a part of academia, but if these papers are meant to educate the public, scientists need to start more casual conversations about the climate crisis.  What's the point of conducting all this research, just in turn to have nobody understand and appreciate your work? We can definitely reach a larger audience by making this information more accessible and consumable for everyone.

I can totally understand what you are saying here. It is true that understanding climate changes is not only about the fact of it, but also about how the information and knowledge of this issue are being understood by the people. There are always people who have different opinions and points of views, the way one understands an issue and how much they are willing to accept a fact or to deny a fact strongly based on how they are being told/taught. Thus, this reading is such a useful one in helping us understand the importance in good communication. And you are totally right, using a more simple and easy to understand language is more easily accepted and understood by people. Also, using metaphors or something that relates to people’s experience/stories also help them to learn the facts.
                         <br><br>
   Climate change is always an issue hard to be addressed and solved, it is more important to get people to learn the facts of it and leave them space to decide themselves on how to think about the issue. In order to get people to take part in actions to help addressing climate crisis, we should get them to learn something they are interested in and more likely to accept and to do. I personally think it is not about getting and forcing people to be convinced with what we say, but to make them willing to understand our points of view and stand on our sides. So, how we are spreading the message and talking about the issue to the public needs the key in having good communication.

<p>
Reading the chapter from “Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions” I was refreshed to see how clear and simple the methods of communication were broken down. It seems easy when you read it, but with such a dire situation like the climate crisis  I think it’s easier said than done to not act on the impulse to just put the fear of the climate crisis into people. 
                         <br><br>

But I think that’s one of the biggest issues with the “environmentalist movement” is the way that we communicate because more often than not, it’ll come off as judgemental as Ken mentioned. I find that most of my friends and family aren’t exactly an “Uncle Pete”, but just an “Average Joe” who admits that the climate crisis is real, but is not motivated or attached enough to make any actions to address it. So it’s a challenge, but what I love about the 5 important steps this chapter addresses to being an effective communicator is that you have to utilize all of these different skills and resources depending on your audience. It’s situational communication. 
                         <br><br>

With many of my friends I try not to shove my lifestyle down their throats. Rather I try to use simple language and analogies to make the issues of the climate crisis in a way that will motivate them and not turn them towards cynicism or hopelessness. I encourage many of my friends to bike or walk rather than driving to get more exercise. I encourage my friends to eat less meat, especially less red meat, because it’s healthier for them, while also helping the planet! The most important thing is to communicate the necessity of their needs before thinking they have the capacity or mental readiness to straight go vegan for the planet first before they can for themselves.

I too was somewhat surprised at how simple the steps proposed by bending the curve were. These are all completely doable and not complicated forms of communication. The facts are easy to digest, and all have a lot of research done on them. Like yourself, I haven’t met many uncle Pete’s, but I know a lot of average joes. People who believe in climate change as well as believe that people are the cause of climate change. However, they don’t actively do anything to mitigate their climate footprint. Sure, they may recycle and look for more environmentally conscious products on occasion, maybe they even give their old clothes to good will. Whatever they are doing, they are more than likely still doing the major actions that contribute to climate change, such as buying/ driving a car, buying a large house and throwing away a large portion of food produced. As educated individuals, we have a conscious decision to make, do we take action to prevent climate change, or do we knowingly make choices that impact the climate negatively. I happen to struggle with this myself almost constantly. Weather its food, or clothes, or driving places, I always have that internal struggle of doing what I want and doing what I know is right. So, most of the time I just eat the burger or buy the clothes, but at least I thought about its impact on the climate and was somewhat reluctant when doing it. All of my favorite things seem to be the things that destroy the planet, and as a society, they are marketed to us as desirable things, new clothes, driving and eating out. As for people who are ignorant to the situation, it would be nice to educate them on the topic so that they can decide for themselves what actions they will and wont take. Either way they will be making a conscious decision to take personal action or not.

I really like the point you made about the "Average Joe." It really hit with me because prior to this class, I could've been classified as an Average Joe, and through Ken's lectures and our readings and documentaries I've moved on from thinking it's real but not really caring. After reading this chapter of "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" and looking back on some of Ken's lectures, it's cool to see how Ken has used some of these strategies. He's used various metaphors throughout the class, he doesn't "bury the lead" as the author mentioned happens often. The section on language was especially interesting to me. The way just using a synonym of the scientific jargon can make such a huge difference. 
                         <br><br>

This chapter felt so simple yet so informative and helpful. It was concise and to the point making it an enjoyable read. It felt like the strategies described are easily applicable to everyday life and conversation. It always boggles my mind how convincing language can be. Whether it be for the better or for the worse, it is always fascinating how to words or phrases that mean the exact same thing will give off completely different vibes and can completely change someones' views. The idea that people have such control over language is somewhat scary, especially after reading just how simple it is



<br><hr>
In this Chapter, I had a new notion of communicating. Literally, communicating methods are so straightforward to understand. When I finished the reading, every argument seemed easy to understand. However,  several arguments were exaggerated such as the climate crisis. Climate crisis is not related to individuals but whole human beings. Overstatement on climate crisis can recently attract attention from the public but it is not a feasible way in a long-run period. In the movie  " The Wandering Earth", the script wrote classic lines that "In the beginning, no one cares about a catastrophe. It is just a mountain fire, a drought, the extinction of a species, the disappearance of a city until the disaster is closely bound up with each person on earth“.  Because the words are very realistic, we have to consider the situation of recent events such as novel coronavirus pneumonia,  severe mountain fire in Australia, plague of locusts in Africa, melting glaciers in Arctic and Antarctic and so on. Those can not be easily addressed by going vegan. Instead, clean and advanced energy and technology and species protection by whole human beings systems.

After reading "Bending the Curve", I was relieved to see a professional understand the damage jargon does to potential readers. While it is understandable that scientists and other educated individuals will use specific vernacular when talking to each other on a topic within their field, it is frustrating at times to attempt to translate jargon into digestible and understandable parts. Not only does it not make sense when attempting to spread awareness on a subject, but it can also create misinterpretations as shown in figure 8.4.2 where jargon is misunderstood for common phrases and such. Regarding the situation with "Uncle Pete", I found the chapter to be highly informational on how to deal with individuals who let stubbornness and political lines decide which side their opinion lies upon. Personally, I feel as if I would not have the necessary patience and needed calmness to confront a person such as "Uncle Pete" but I found that Sommerville's instruction to advise and not to tell and force upon is probably the best method when engaging with such an individual. To finish off, I wanted to talk about how good it is that a scientist is talking about communication. Often times, I feel as if scientists lose interested readers because their writing is as the chapter explained, 'Hiding the lead", or plainly, it just takes too long to actually understand what the article is talking about. This ultimately causes readers to see the article as pointless or just not worth it.

I agree with Felix that jargon is causing harm to the audience. In the article "Bending the Curve", it states that jargon is a serious issue when trying to convince people of the climate change crisis. Jargon and other rhetorical strategies are used to convince people that climate change isn't real. Manipulating and confusing people with wrong information so that people believe that climate change isn't real. The best way to attack and convince people that climate change is real is to make statements that are short and simple. It is stated in the article that the more information is listed the fewer people are paying attention. It is true because when people are being talked to with just statistics and words that they do not comprehend they lose interest. Thus, making statements and claims that are simple will apply to more people. Jargon is a way that two people from the same profession talk to each other and use terminology that they know. However, when talking to the public it is crucial to be brief and simple. The issue of climate change needs to be simple so that people can understand it and know the severity of the issue.


<br><hr>
Eduardo RuizFelix This is a really great comment! I also found it very hard to confront “Uncle Pete” in a correct manner that wouldn’t have me explode with anger which is why I’m so glad that the article gives the reader information on how to deal with certain situations such as that. Felix is right many readers lose focus when scientist are only looking at the scientific way of things and only that which isn’t really intriguing however with talks about communication coming from scientist I was able to gain knowledge and actually pay attention.

For this week's reading, "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions," it was really interesting to see read about how to communicate climate change science. For the first section, it talked about the first steps to communicating by knowing the general principles of communicating and adequate knowledge of climate change. The second section gave an example, Uncle Pete, about how there's always a person that does not accept climate change. The third section talked about metaphors which can be used as a tool for communication. It compares climate science with medical science and CO2 with the drug, steroids. In the next section, it talked about language which is important when matching the language that you use to the audience. In the last section talked about solutions which are entirely to be optimistic about ending climate change.

I agree that the reading "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" was a very interesting one.  I found Somerville's advice to be helpful in how each person should try to talk to their own "Uncle Pete."   The reading was insightful as to how we should bring about the climate crisis conversation.   In a society where people continuously deny the effects of climate change present in today's world, Somerville gave a good argument for the climate crisis being everyone's responsibility.  This issue isn't just one for scientists to solve, it is a problem that affects everybody. I appreciate Ken's part of the video where he talks about himself personally.  As someone who highly contributes to the resolution of this issue by spreading awareness and taking part in the daily choices he makes, I admire Ken's attitude in not losing hope amongst the people who aren't taking the necessary steps.  For the climate crisis to be a very crucial issue, I could see how it can become frustrating at times to not see a collective effort to solve the problem.

I really enjoyed reading this chapter because I found the language used is very comprehensible and easy to follow. It tackles a topic that I rarely read about: methods to communicate with people about the climate crisis issue. I especially loved the analogy of Uncle Pete because to me, Uncle Pete not only resembles someone who does not believe in climate change, but anyone who refuses to listen to or accept new ideologies besides those that align with their own. Uncle Pete is definitely a successful visualization of this type of person and really put me in the situation where the conversation is happening between me and a climate change denier. Now after reading I feel more comfortable and confident talking to people who holds a strong opposition against climate change issues and persuade them gradually with a different attitude (I would be very impatient before reading this) and new tactics.

What Ken said in the video was very inspiring too. I came to the realization that I don’t need to be a complete vegetarian to become a climatarian, and it’s the same for not only diet but other things as well. It is a gradual process, both becoming a climatarian and influencing others to become one. There should be a spectrum measuring our actions and impacts, from acknowledging and believing the occurrence of climate crisis to putting our belief into personal actions. Just as Ken said, eating a burger with a pound of turkey is better than one with a pound of beef, and one with lentils is even better. Pizzas with vegetables are better than those with chicken. How far you go with your personal actions matters, of course, but the most important thing is that you carry the attention for climate crisis in mind and do everything with the consideration of it. Maybe it’s just going to be one less plane ticket, maybe it’s less clothes you buy every month, or maybe it’s merely one more pedaling to school rather than asking your mom to drive you. Smaller steps make big difference, and that’s true for communication and persuasion as well.

I agree that it was very easy to follow the language in the reading. I also agree with your points on Uncle Pete. It's so important that we listen to different viewpoints and methods of living in today's world because it is so easy to constantly only believe what you want to. Uncle Pete resembles so much of our culture today with people instantly denying the reality of climate change without really knowing any facts. In addition, I would definitely now be more comfortable with talking to climate change deniers just to see where they don't believe in it, and hopefully I would be able to convince them otherwise. 
                         <br><br>


Ken's video was important for me, too. I realized that there are several levels to dieting to resolve the climate crisis because not everybody can make the same commitments as the rest. I have already tried to limit beef consumption and rather eat turkey and chicken instead, but I've found the transition really tough. However, I think it's good that I'm focusing on this and other changes. These smaller steps really do make a much bigger difference than I had previously thought, and I hope that people will start to realize that these minor changes help our planet out massively.

I definitely enjoyed the reading and video for this week, but I had a little trouble with the fact that people often stigmatize vegans and veganism. In my opinion it should not carry a negative connotation, and vegans often don't attempt to portray themselves as holier than thou. This may be because in my personal experience all vegans I have met just want whats best for the environment and animals and have good intentions, but I also think that if you feel vegans hold a position of higher morality, it is probably well earned. Vegans do what they do because they value the lives of animals to an equal level of humans and choose not to eat them or support animal cruelty.  I hope that the stigma changes and that vegans aren't seen as doing what they're doing to portray themselves as better than everybody else. Other than that I really liked this text because it helped almost prepare me for if I'm ever dealing with an "Uncle Pete" who refuses to believe the climate crisis is real.

It made me feel a little sad when Ken mentioned that just discussing his vegan practices with friends made dinners awkward and that he had to shy away from it.  My best friend at home is vegan and I remember towards the end of high school people being pretty weird about that fact and only not 'bullying' her over it because she was attractive and smart and kind of a cool girl.  It just always gave me a weird feeling, I always felt confused why people were so offended when others were vegans.  Literally only a single time had a vegan ever tried to abrasively shame me, it was at a vegan demonstration I happened upon with friends at Washington Square park.  The girl was clearly not from New York, and just accidentally got herself confused and flustered and was still trying to convert / shame us.  It was a weird experience but it only happened to me a single time, vegans in my experience didn't have a vendetta to destroy me on any given day.  I liked the idea of terms that inspire questions and curiousity, people are always much more receptive to information that they seek out opposed to that they feel they are having forced upon them.  It seems more than anything, the fear of vegans is just the threat to our common practices and creature comforts.  The information that influences vegans and other environmentally conscious or restricted diets is so important and it seems silly that all of that is undermined by the villianous title vegans were so unfairly awarded.

First I would like to talk about the video. The idea of a climatarian has been an idea that I’ve enjoyed since I took ENG 22 and I even decided to cut beef out of my diet and go vegetarian on most weekends. I don’t know if i will ever be able to convert to full veganism or vegetarianism, but I will likely attempt to eat in ways that favor the environment. To be honest being a freegan sounds like a good idea, but I don’t really know where to start and therefore may never be able to adopt that. Anyway, my “climatarian diet” has been quite the easy transition,yes I crave beef sometimes, but I can always just substitute it with chicken or turkey. I think making adjustments to eating habits is a person to person problem, but it is a very doable change. Now to the reading. This class is a non-science course talking about climate change. Quite strange if you don’t understand all the intricacies of this problem. Climate change is a problem from all angles, writing, reading, science, math, and history. This chapter of the book exemplifies the fact that the climate crisis is also a problem of communicating. Scientists are not the best at communicating the complexities of science in a way in which everyone would understand, and therefore having writers and expert communicators is very important. This is what the chapter is saying, that to be able to convince people of the problems you need to know your audience and be able to communicate the topic. This can be enhanced by a better understanding of the science so you know the facts of the problem. I think the ideas in the chapter about communicating to “Uncle Pete” were very effective ways of communicating and can be used. I have a lot of relatives and even friends who are not very well aware of the problems and using these tactics could be very helpful when I’m talking to them about the topic of the climate crisis. I am not a very effective communicator, but this chapter was really helpful and I will try to use these ideas when talking to people who need to be informed.

I am a Communications major. One of the main reasons why I wanted to become a communications major is because I wanted to learn how to better communicate the importance of taking care of our environment. Communicating the climate crisis is very important. Scientists are great at finding data and facts. However, their jargon and scientific attitude makes it hard for the common person to understand what they are talking about. The environmental crisis must be communicated in a simple way. I believe that the fear approach and the hopeful approach are both needed. In my case, I am a huge optimist! I believe that the climate crisis can be a positive thing as it can potentially help bring humanity together. I want to communicate the climate crisis in a way that gets people excited to want to create a better world!

I definitely agree in the fact that the climate crisis really needs to learn how to communicate better. Before I signed up for this course, it was very obvious to me that the media perception of the climate crisis, from both sides of the political spectrum, were using some sort of radicalized logic when discussing the issue. It really annoyed, and still does, that an issue that is potentially world ending could be such a partisan issue, especially one that divides like no other. Some people will claim that the entire thing is a conspiracy treaty created by socialists, and others will argue that the world is ending and if we dont change our entire lives by tomorrow we are all doomed. Like most things, i think the climate crisis is in the middle ground of either extreme, but it was very hard to see that from my first impressions of the situation. The idea of communication has changed my perspective on how we need to go about the situation, because most people out there will be just as confused as I was about the subject. Starting healthy discussions about change and making an effort to try and transition people into "climatarian" practices rather than yelling at people and telling them they are wrong is a great way for society to move towards climate-pro habits. I myself am vegetarian, but for my whole life I've had no problem with other people eating meats. While I still don't really have a problem with it, the climate side of me wants to try and convince people to eat other alternatives, but I would try and slowly convince my friends instead of yelling at them and telling them they are terrible people. I agree with you that we should look optimistically about the future of our society, especially if it can be a cause that humanity can collectively fight for, but there will 100% need to be a more dynamic form of communication for it to work.

I really liked the wording and how this chapter is written. It's very easy to follow like most of the readings Ken has had us read, and it's very blunt which I appreciate. The way chapter 8 on Communicating climate Change Science was split into parts was also interestingly easy to keep up with his main points. He starts with Preparation, Stories, Metaphors, and lastly Solutions. The start of the chapter basically sums up the chapter because they start with their philosophy statement "use simple clear, messages repeated often, by a variety of trusted messengers". This chapter is like instructions but interesting ones. I've had encounters with people who do give off the "superior morality" attitude and those encounters make me cringe and get me frustrated because of how easy they make it seem, which its not for a lot of people for many reasons. I myself do what I can do eat a plant based diet and would like to convince others to do the same but not the way I've seen people try so hard to convince people to do so. Like Ken states, it's important to not fully talk to someone about your personal actions and not start that conversation directly. The chapter we read also states when having conversations on the climate crisis to provide solutions and not just leave folks with a sense of hopelessness. Chapter 8 also mentions that not a lot of people are exposed to scientists, and this is a reflection of the education system which I 100% agree with. I would really like to see a lot of more schools expose children to scientist and the climate crisis because I know for myself at my school with LAUSD we only took a basic chemistry class my senior year of HS and that was it (in which we were taught things like the periodic table which like the chapter states shouldn't be the priority).

I also feel chapter 8 from "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" correctly communicated solutions in a way that kept the reader interested and informed. Although majority of the information in the reading seemed a little repetitive to me, the metaphors kept me interested and I could see how people who've never heard about these issues would stay to read. Specifically, the "sticky" metaphor of carbon dioxide being the steroids of climate change was something I had never heard of before. Like both you and the author mentioned, not a lot of people know scientists or in my case, anyone who is able to correctly inform about climate change. The education system is at a huge fault for not directing the generation, who will be the most affected, to readings like these. It is crazy to me that if I had never taken this class, I would have probably never made changes to my life, some as simple as not using plastic products or being more mindful of what I consume.

Ken stating the negative baggage that comes with mentioning your diet choices is one hundred percent true. I recently became vegetarian and I am currently dreading telling my old school family as I know they will be disappointed.This coincides with the reading's persona of "Uncle Pete". The fact is many people are ignorant and are just looking for an argument rather than educated. It often seems hopeless to me when I tell my friends and family they should stop using paper plates or utensils and be more mindful of what they eat but I get shot down or laughed at each time. The response I usually get is always politics related as well. While it is shameful I can't get the point across, this makes readings like this week's more important. I believe we all have a responsibility to this planet to educate ourselves and to help guide others to the correct scientific information.

I really enjoyed this week's reading from "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" because it not only spewed information at us, or just explained the solutions , but it took a very unique approach, which was disproving the myths and falsehoods of those who claim our Climate Crisis is a "Hoax". I think this approach for looking at climate change is deemed to be very interesting, but it's effective because it's not just arguing it's educating and discussing others about our global crisis and environmental issues. One of the first and biggest steps we need to take in taking on this climate crisis is educating everyone about the drastic issue we are facing, because half the people who refute these claims are people who haven't been properly educated or exposed to the truths behind our climate issues. This is important because if we are able to educate those around us, we might be able to truly change the minds of those around us, which would be the first step in making a change, and actually starting people on the path in making a difference in the world. 
                         <br><br>
What really intrigued me was the way of thinking behind the "Climataranism" was that many people seem to demonize these sort of environmentally friendly mindsets, because they see it as a danger or as attack on their personal freedom of choice, when in reality it's just advising  them on the choices that make in their everyday lives. These sort of precautions are meant to dictate your life, but just guide your choices, make you much more aware of the different options you have available, as well as how the different you choices you choose to make in your everyday life have a profound effect on not only the Earth but people around the world, because in the end they are linked. 
                         <br><br>
Your final advice "Before you can change the world, you need to change yourself" has a very deep and truthful underling meaning, because in order for us to actually change the world and all the bs going on we need to change the way we act and the things we do because the reality of it all is that our actions have consequences and now it has become extremely evident of how bad we have fucked up this world. We need to change now, before it's too late.

I completely agree with all the points you have made. Its frustrating to think that "climataranism" actually exist because in order to begin seeing change we need to start with our own lives. I feel like those who think we are "trying to tell them how to live their lives" are not aware of the climate crisis completely, like they think they won't be affected by it. No one can escape the climate crisis. And it's not like were asking them to completely change your life, choose one thing to work on at a time then you will realize how much better life is. Building on that, I feel like the climate crisis is constantly trying to be proven "fake" or whatever, when we should make people understand that this is a true issue we have to face. We need more educated or people aware of the crisis in order to inspire change.


<br><hr>
I agree with you, this weeks reading was more interesting, and more useful in a sense, because it proved that Climate Change is real by debunking several falsehoods regarding it. A scientific theory is a hypothesis that cannot be proved wrong, and by disproving that climate change is a hoax, the reading serves to strengthen the argument that climate change is a real problem and a theory widely accepted by the scientific community. 
                         <br><br>

I do believe that people wind up demonizing certain practices not because of the practice itself (e.g. being vegan, vegetarian, etc.), but because of how these groups promote them sometimes. In my city there have been many times were protesters showed random people in the street explicit pictures of dead and tortured animals calling them murderers, making accusations. This type of aggressive behavior is exactly why these groups are demonized. I understand that a small portion of them do this, but it still causes an impression over the whole community.

Communication is an important part in life. It is easier to let people express what they think and address the ideas they want to convince. Normally, there are plenty of arguments and conflicts in terms of the problem of climate crisis. Mentioning “intergenerational equity” and demonstrating “moral and ethical issues” can effectively inform people about the importance of how climate change issues morally affect them. In addition, I agree with your saying that people are not aware of the severe situation of the crisis due to the lack of education and experience of how the climate crisis has impacted them.

This weeks reading and this video were helpful but also frustrating. 
                         <br><br>

I’ll start with Ken’s video. It was frustrating to be told that the best way to get people to change their actions is to wait for them to ask you. After taking this class and learning about all the ways that we can reduce our carbon footprints (drive less, eat less meat, waste less food, etc...), I have wanted to tell everyone I know about it! But, knowing communication was a topic we would cover, I was waiting until this week to make sure that I could communicate these changes to my friends and family in the best way possible. I am let down by the method given, but to be honest, I don’t really know what other magical method I was expecting. I know that people are not going to change their actions unless THEY want to, so I guess Ken’s method of waiting until they ask you is really the best way to go about it. What I did really enjoy about this video though was the topic of diet labels. I was vegetarian for several years before just recently deciding to go vegan. I quickly learned that, typically, the only conversation non-vegans want to have with vegans around diets start with them asking you how you get your protein and ends with them telling you that they could just never be vegan because they love meat and cheese too much. By the end of that conversation, I don’t have a clue what to say anymore because I know that they are not listening. This happens quite a bit for me as I live with 7 other people (1 vegan, 2 vegetarians, and 4 omnivores). The most frustrating thing that I learned as I labeled myself a vegan was that people have high expectations of you to hold to a vegan diet and not “cheat,” otherwise you’re not a “true vegan.” This happened to me when a housemate received a cake from her friend on her birthday. By the next day, she had half a cake left that she said she wasn’t going to eat and no one else in my house wanted. So, not wanting the rest of the cake to go into the garbage. I said I would eat it. I was quickly berated by my housemates with comments about how I’m not a real vegan. It was extremely frustrating. This is why a climatarian diet appeals to me. Not only because I think it better describes how I eat, but because I think that it will open up conversations with my friends rather than them being put off by the vegan label.
                         <br><br>

Next, the reading also frustrated me. What really stuck with me is when they said that most people have never met a scientist. At first this shocked me but I realized it is so true, even in my family. I am the first person in my family to pursue a career in the sciences, and I never met a scientist until coming to UCSB. When I realized this, I started thinking about all of my family members who have never met a scientist and probably don’t know how the scientific process works for attaining data about the climate. This is probably the source of most misconceptions about climate science – simply not knowing how it actually works. This is a big problem! The reading even stated that only one member of congress in 2018 had a PhD in the sciences, and these are the people making policies based on climate science! This was frustrating to read. What we have to do now is educate people so that they understand the facts of what is going on.

Your birthday cake story is such a relatable concept. I am not restrictive with my diet but I have a lot of notoriously vegan friends: i.e. instagram posts regarding their diets and constant reference to their choices in conversation. It's annoying when it's that "in your face", and while I know a lot of people choose veganism for environmental reasons, a lot of girls try out the diet for different health or trend reasons as well. So on new years eve this year when I was spending the evening with my favorite vegan, as the night went on, one of those table sized pizzas showed up at our house and we started wandering closer to the snack table. After sharing chips and guac to our hearts content, she looks at me and says "Will you judge me if I have some pizza?" Of course, I don't care if my friend eats some pizza, but being someone so proud of her diet I understand her hesitation to let anyone see her step out of bounds. So I watched my little vegan enjoy her first three slices of pizza in almost two years, and I felt so much joy to watch her let herself be free from her mindful commitment. That is one important aspect of communication that wasn't touched on in the chapter assigned: the necessity for flexibility and understanding. 
                         <br><br>

In my opinion, as stated by many other students, it can be a trivial topic to college students on exactly how one should be communicating regarding the climate. In all of our english and rhetoric classes we are taught to condense our sentences and write with respect to our specific audiences. We have known since elementary school the power of metaphors. Perhaps the most valuable takeaway from the chapter is the condition of waiting until they want to hear you. I understand this first hand, coming from a family of conservative kids with five uncles from Missouri. No one wants to hear anything about not using a straw, and I am laughed at when I bring up conservation or diet suggestions regarding the environment. The ridicule I receive is not so much surrounding disbelief in the environmental issues, but rather from those older than me scoffing that I might have better lifestyle choices for them than the ones they are choosing. People do not want to be told to change, so no matter what I am communicating to them, their stubborn attitudes will not waver. However, I know that my family is just like this, and it has given me good practice for more ridicule that I may face in the future.

I'm not sure what I was expecting for this week's reading, but I'm glad Ken assigned it. I liked that the reading gave us tips on how to discuss the controversial issue, climate change. I know for a fact that some people are just plain out ignorant when it comes to the topic. I've had conversations with random people, and family members, about climate change and their views on it which has sometimes led to disagreements and arguments. When people are serious when they say they don't believe climate change is real, all I can do is sit there and wonder whether they're just oblivious or plain out stupid... I think it's my generation's duty to speak out and inform everyone they can about the climate crisis and how we can work towards saving our planet. I like that Ken tells us to initiate the conversation, because many people will choose to shut down the topic. Getting people to become more open minded and open to changes is what'll help us move forward in this world. No matter how bad things get, I appreciate how the reading told us to stay optimistic and focus more on acting now rather than later. We must all take action as soon as possible before it becomes too late and our effects on the world become irreversible.

It is most definitely our generations duty to speak out and inform everyone. Part of me, I'll admit, is frustrated that it's been left to us, but another part of me accepts it and takes on the responsibility. I, like you, have experienced similar issues when trying to convince people of the realness, severity, or solutions to climate change. I think the most important piece of advise this reading puts forward is to listen to the other person, to address their fears and concerns. Because that's what's blocking the actual information - fear. That's what we need to dismantle.

Knowing your audience is such an important advice. Many comments in the past have expressed the concerns on how to convince the “Uncle Pete” in their life. And this chapter shows us that in order to convince someone, you need to know what he or she thinks. Maybe that someone just doesn’t think the effects are real, maybe that someone thinks the government will take control of our lives (which is ironic because our lives are under the control of the corporations). Telling hard facts without knowing what that person is actually confused about will most likely annoy the person.
                           <br><br>
 The problem is that scientists are good at telling hard facts. Communication at this level has always been difficult for scientists—making something convincing and straightforward while not losing its nuances is not what scientists are taught to do. The intricacy of science is especially hard to get across and many so-called “climate change skeptics” often use this “weakness” to “falsify” the results of climate scientists. This aim for accuracy often makes the facts ambiguous to the public. This chapter makes clear that a scientist needs to learn how to be a journalist as well.
                         <br><br>

   This introduction video reminds me of Cowspiracy. I still remember the quote “you can’t be an environmentalist if you eat meat” from the movie, as well as how they claim that how giving up meat in one day of the week is not going to help. It is factual for sure—cutting meat consumption by one seventh is not going to be a significant change, but discrediting small step towards vegetarian or vegan like that is not going to convince people. I suppose the people who are going to watch this movie are people who don’t realize how much agriculture has contributed to the overall carbon emission and do want to know what they can do, and it will be disappointing to see that this movie just says “well you are essentially doing nothing to help by eating a hamburger”. I can see myself labeling this movie as alarming (as in alarmist) and extreme if I haven’t been exposed to the climate issue extensively.

Climate change is something I feel rather passionate about, as isn't uncommon for many of the students in this class. I know a lot about the issue thanks to this class as well as last quarter's. Having known little about the crisis other than it was bad until enrolling, I feel as though I'm somewhat versed in the topic. Obviously nowhere near those of true scientists, but enough to communicate it to people uncertain about the details. Only issue, I'm not very good at talking about it. In part maybe due to awkwardness, but the other half can be attributed to the fact that despite knowing the facts, I legitimately have no idea how to formulate them. 

                         <br><br>

Talking to my dad--someone who acknowledges that climate change might be something that exists, but stands by the fact that it's not that big of an impact, telling me that science is always changing anyway--I know I'm on the winning side of the argument and yet somehow after each conversation I'm left seeming like he took the upper hand. It's incredibly frustrating, and this article was actually quite useful in being able to consider better ways to effectively represent the facts for climate change. I definitely feel like I'm one of the people who just spew all the scientific knowledge I can (and without much rhyme or reason), and "Being the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" really helped me see the structure and noting that some information is more important than others. I never thought of the "science" of communicating "science," but this was really eye-opening. Even Ken's mention of trying to refrain from shutting down a conversation but rather spark curiosity and make sure that the timing is right is such a thoughtful approach I never considered. I tend to just get defensive and argumentative , which is clearly not the right answer.

After reading the chapter 8, first, I learn that there are five categories in order to communicate in the science of climate change including preparation with knowledge, stories related to people who do not accept climate change, metaphors, tools for communication, a language with precise description, and solutions to provide optimistic tools. From the five characteristics, I understand the preparation the most. Communication is one of the most powerful tools to speak out your ideas to others. But if you want to express yourself well, there should be good skills and ways to reach it. “The more you say, the less they hear” is really a core to communicate. As a messenger or scientists of climate change, we cannot speak all the information all at a time but sort of important and keywords to hit audiences’ heart. Many scientists as the book talks about are trapped into how to communicate with audiences and how to introduce climate change clearly. I believe that if scientists can learn how to communicate with audiences and in this way, more and more people will be aware of what is climate change and how important it is. Knowing your audiences, knowing yourself, be confident and using facts are all critical points to engage your audiences. All in all, I sincerely think that these five suggestions to scientists of climate change is useful and an effective guanidine to help them overcome the trap of communicating their ideas of “climate change” to common people. Moreover, these scientists communicate with people like Uncle Pete.

I agree with you and I think I liked the part "preparation" more. In fact, I think preparation is the most important part of communication. People need evidence in order to believe in others, especially when people do not have background knowledge. Professor Ken provides many data and ideals to us in the lecture regarding the climate crisis. But professor Ken is the medium of communicating some of the data to us, scientists are the ones who come out with those data. As the book that scientists do not know how to communicate with others, I think those scientists need a medium like professor Ken to spread the words to the world. Even Al Gore, as US's former vice president, he delivers speeches regarding climate issues all the time, but I think those data he has shown are finished by himself, it was coming from different agencies. He also knows what the audience wants, which corporates one of the characteristics of communication and as you said:" knowing your audiences, knowing yourself, be confident and using facts are all critical points to engage your audiences". Probably what we need is a team. This book can be really helpful for scientists when they try to deliver certain messages to the world.

Many points that you brought up in your comment resonated with me. I think that climate scientists and people of academia obviously have to tackle the obstacle of properly communicating their findings to people who may not have the same background or understanding of the topics that they deal with on a day to day basis, meaning that many things can be either lost in translation or severely downplayed in terms of pressing severity, such as in this case the severity of climate change. People such as myself and many others would not like to be bombarded with a barrage of statistics and facts that don't mean anything to us and would rather deal with more easily conveyed information that gives us a clear idea of any pressing issues that need to be taken care of so its easier to visualize. That's not to say that we need to have less information and evidence to back up our claims, which obviously is very important. We just need to package this info in better ways for the common person to understand. Knowing one's audience and keeping a consistent tone that they can familiarize themselves with is very important if you are trying to persuade them of something and also makes it much more easier to get your point across. Without proper communication, people may associate you with someone who is not knowledgable about a certain issue and therefore will be less likely to agree with any points that you may have, so it is highly important to come prepared when it comes to controversial issues such as how to deal with climate change.

I agree with the quote as well, “the more you talk the less people want to hear from you.” This is the sad truth; Ken also says that we must wait for a person a to be ready in order to fight climate change. We are limited in time; we are running out of time we cannot wait for everyone until they are ready to talk about change. I do not think that we can afford to wait. I find the way Ken approached climate change and compared it to vegetarianism, I feel like in a way it made it simpler to follow.

The reference to Uncle Pete in chapter 8.2 of the reading as someone who "insists on frequently repeating several climate myths and falsehoods, which he believes are true" reminds me of a family member I have who has similar views of a stubborn conservative who refuses to see otherwise. I recall sitting down and eating a meal with this family member when the topic of climate change was brought up. He was so set on his views despite me and other family members telling him that his viewpoint was wrong and not updated. Sure, his belief that climate change was a hoax and not a real thing could have been a little more accurate during his time, but now it is more prevalent than ever. It is important to note that there are many people who share the same viewpoint as well who may not understand that the updated technology and rapid pace of the world is working to show just how big of an issue the climate crisis is. There are many people who are misinformed on the facts and it is our responsibility to educate them on the matter so that they too can start working to make a more positive impact in the world. I think Ken is a great professor in the ways in which he does not shut down anybody's viewpoint, but instead provides solid facts and evidence by real researchers and presents it to the class. In doing so, we are able to develop our own viewpoint given the knowledge that we have instead of remaining fixated on old beliefs.

Throughout the reading, “Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions,” and watching Ken’s video, I have realized that it is dire that we communicate action to people of all walks of life. I thought it was interesting and innovative that the ways to convince people of climate change were broken into preparation, stories, metaphors, and solutions. This way, there is an outline of options to use in convincing the listener. I think it is interesting, also, that scientists are discouraged from saying a lot when speaking to the general public; they must consider their audience. 
                         <br><br>

I thought Ken’s personal anecdote about conversations being shut down when he says he is vegan is very prevalent in today’s society. The term “climatarian” and “freegan” initiate conversation, rather than shut it down. Ken explains that climatarians are not die hard vegans, rather people who “act on the knowledge as best [they] can,” that the food they eat effects the climate in huge ways. This approach encourages asking questions, rather than forcing information on people that they don’t want to hear. It promotes being curious about important lifestyle changes that can help the planet if implemented. 
                         <br><br>

There should not be opinions or stances on climate change. Climate change is happening as we speak. It is written in the article that it is “not a partisan opinion or a political statement,” which I believe is painfully obvious. The advice on how to talk to Uncle Pete and others is very useful and informative. Now, I know how to talk to others about climate change, and not push information onto them that they don’t want.

I agree with you Elizabeth! It is very true that communication is very helpful to idea exchanges. In the book "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" indicates an effective way that we can do together after we leave the class. Being an environmental activist can spread our idea to more people and persuade more citizens of the earth to join us and protect the planet. I really like Ken's lecture, because students have the opportunity to speak out under the stage. The ideas spread out by that small microphone, but the effect of the communication is great.
                          <br><br>

This reading raised my awareness of the importance of communication. Also, the way of communication is actually more crucial. It is because we use our knowledge or scientific evidence to tell others. It is a discussion opportunity for everyone to participate. We should all be active and communicate more with others. Sometimes, people do not realize there is an alternative way to do certain things. And this is the time to introduce the communication and the alternative idea.

In this week's reading bending the curve climate change solutions, it especially stood out to me because if you offer too much information I wasn't asked for, it can come off as arrogant or almost misleading because you entirely bought into the issue. I especially appreciate Kens Approach which is to wait until the information is asked of you to provide your outlook. Usually, I miss trusting people that come to me where too much information and are also excited about the issue. Seems as if they are socially invested in a fad and it never seems to last. Oh, when I'm genuinely interested, I'd like to ask that information and try to gather as my schedule it as possible. Also this is when the education to stays in my heart I would never forget another personal to me. What are you overcome in trying to remove people of clementines is that I don't have any change agree. Yes, I am in a climate change class and took English 22 as well, but I'm an ego major. And each one picture and the future of clinic change? I have Tiffany with me I will be taking especially if I had more background chemistry. I also feel that I do not have enough knowledge to become politically active in This issue. It is so complicated it's hard to know how to remodel fact there are so many different factors to look at. But I think that education is key to advancing the climate crisis.

I agree that it was a good idea to break up the process of informing about climate change into different strategies. This allows you to feed into your audience and how they learn. Choosing the most effective communication strategy is important. I find it funny that scientists are discouraged from saying too much, but it makes sense. As a biology major, I am so accustomed to seeing chemical formulas and knowing what they mean. However, one time when I was talking about chemistry to one of my friends they were completely lost on concepts I had deemed basic knowledge. This surprised me, but it also opened my eyes to see that not everyone has had the same education in more specialized fields.
                          <br><br>


I also liked Ken's strategies for initiating conversations about his lifestyle. I think it is smart to not force something onto someone but rather let them come to you. Recently I started playing a game mode of a game that my friend also plays. However, he did not like to play the mode that I was playing. As I slowly got better at the game, I began to increase my rank/division which got his attention. He then started asking me about how I was increasing my rank and getting better at the game. We started to play non-ranked (these games don't affect your rank/division) and eventually got into the more serious ranked games, all because he approached me about it (and I didn't force anything onto him). I think it is a strategy I will start implementing when trying to talk to others about climate change.

I really enjoyed this reading because it was so accessible and easy to understand. It presented the information in the same way that it was advising on how to communicate; no jargon and easy to understand sentences. I found this to be an important aspect of the climate crisis: addressing the deniers. I know “Uncle Pete’s” in my life and this truly did offer a comprehensive guide on how to address climate change deniers in a non-provocative way. At times it can be so frustrating and mind blowing when someone denies science but this put a new perspective on it as it analyzed how science isn’t what a lot of deniers have on their mind. It is the fear of government control in their life and their rigid belief in the free market. Rather than addressing the science they ignore it and are pressed on the concern that climate change activists are infringing on their lifestyles. It is still incredibly frustrating as it is such a narrow and quite frankly, stupid mindset. But we have to move past that in order to approach the subject maturely in a way that actually has a chance of getting to their mind instead of immediately being pushed aside. The science is there and up to them to believe but since their mindset has little to do with the actual science, it is important to communicate to them in ways that they understand. I think the biggest thing is knowing who your audience is. The climate crisis’s effects are going to be so widespread in different sectors of life that there is a way to make the issue personal to everyone. What I also found very interesting and true was the comparison between medical science and climate science. People believe their doctors even without an understanding of medical science but they refuse to believe climate scientists even when some of the science is based on elementary principles. That is a comparison I hadn’t thought about before and is very true. The communication techniques that they describe in the book are very applicable and I will be using them when discussing climate change with skeptics and deniers.

I completely agree with Ken's more subtle approach in communicating the climate crisis to your peers. Often times, when I walk through the Arbor pathway in front of the library, many different organizations try to hand me a flyer or inform me of an event. However, it is usually done in an aggressive way that makes me completely uninterested in what they're saying, so I usually just put in my earphones and walk as fast as I can. This is how I feel about people who try to force their eating habits on others. When someone simply says they're vegan, there isn't much conversation that follows, as Ken noted. People already know what veganism is, and usually are opposed to trying it. I personally am not vegan (though I hope one day I will be), but I do think about the impact of my eating habits on the environment. Before learning what a climatarian is, I would call myself a reducitarian (someone who strives to reduce consumption of animal products). As I've told people this, many perk up and are curious as to what this fancy-sounding word is.Talking about my personal choices in a more subdued way has opened a conversation numerous times about the impacts of the meat industry on climate change.

                          <br><br>

One quote from this video that I particularly enjoyed was, "Anyone can make freegan decisions throughout the day." I think this also applies to climitarianism/reducitarianism. Committing yourself to being vegan, vegetarian, or even pescatarian, is extremely daunting. Many people would give an excuse along the lines of, "I could never give [insert meat or dairy product] up!" However, making little decisions throughout your day or your week makes a profound impact on the climate crisis. For example, if someone decided to not include meat during one of their meals throughout the day, they are emitting 1/3 less carbon dioxide than they usually would for that day. These small, attainable changes give people a sense of empowerment that might grant them the confidence to cut back from their diet even more. This first step can be the stepping stone to a plant-based future. Keeping this in mind, as well as implementing stories and metaphors as the authors of Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions had proposed, I think more people would be open to living a greener life.

This week's reading was on  communication and how to tackle informing others about the climate crisis. Uncle Pete is brought up in chapter 8 as someone who does not believe in climate change. They give us the reasoning as to why many people think climate change is a hoax. The main reason they think it is a lie is because they believe it is a tactic to get the government more involved in people's lives and for there to be more regulation. The uncle Pete's of the world are afraid of being controlled and no longer having a free market. However, the chapter also mentions that without doing anything (wait uncle Pete's want) it will lead to the government having to regulate eventually when everything becomes chaotic. This chapter also brought interesting points of how people are so unwilling to trusts scientists. They are specialized in what they do and yet people are still unwilling to believe their findings of the earth heating due to human causes. They bring up how medical doctors are never questioned even though we know that medical science is not perfect and yet we do not do the same for climate scientists. They are seen as people whose opinion cannot be trusted even though they are the ones specializing in the area of climate and as they said, the Earth is their patient. I admired how they emphasis the importance of communication so that people are able to understand the crisis. One way was by breaking things down to what people already understand. "Baseball fans understand that a player using performance-enhancing drugs such as steroids doesn't always hit home runs, but the drugs increase the odds of the player hitting home runs. In a similar way, adding heat-trapping substances such as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere increases the odds of heat waves and heavy precipitation events".

I appreciate how Ken practices the methods encouraged in this chapter, especially in the sense of not burying the lead when it comes to climate change. He was not hypocritical in the way he has taught this class. In the first few weeks, he alarmed us of what has happened. Next, he gave us some ways we could fix it individually (Minimalism, etc.). Then, he gave us ways that a large group of people can make a difference (Green New Deal, Public transportation/biking in Denmark and Colombia). Now, he is telling us how we can effectively tell other people about the climate crisis. 

                          <br><br>

One of the things that stood out to me was the language section of the chapter. I agree that people need to stop flexing their linguistic muscles as much. The problem with smart people is that they always want to prove how smart they are! This needs to stop! They need to start using language that we use in everyday life. The fact that a lot of the class did not know what "anthropogenic" meant at the beginning of the quarter probably means we should stop using the word when we want to prove a point. Stop using celsius when we live in the United States and nobody wants to do the math to change it to Fahrenheit. The article emphasizes both of these and for good reason. I am of the belief that there is always a simpler way to explain things. It is probably not the scientist's faults that spokespeople are not translating their findings into "real world English", but I think there is something wrong with the system in this sense.

I completely agree with Brett and the reading on the idea that the climate crisis needs to be explained in much simpler terms. It’s completely true that what it really boils down to is “what do we owe the future generations to come on this planet?” and I think framing it in that way, instead of politically, addresses much more people. At the heart, I do think most people just want to be happy and healthy and for their loved ones to be too. That’s how we have to frame the climate crisis. Many older people in my family have discussed it with me, as I have been the “environmental vegan” in my family for quite a while now. And while they shut down veganism and environmentalism at first, when I talk to them about how much it’ll affect my future, and my anxiety over that, they’re much more receptive and actually start realizing that it is affecting us right now, not just indirectly. 
                          <br><br>

I also find that Ken’s point about letting people come to you for information when they’re ready is better than approaching them about it is really good. Sometimes it can be frustrating, but people are much more likely to make the change if they don’t feel direct pressure and get defensive. I was the first to go vegan in my family, and now many of my friends, family, and coworkers have stopped eating meat. But that didn’t happen because I told them to, it was more because they noticed me doing it and sometimes talking about it when someone asked, and eventually made the choice themselves. I think the most important thing is keeping it a two-sided conversation, not just a lecture.


<br><Hr>
I agree with your second point about letting people come to you in terms of information about the climate change. I find people coming up to me and telling me information about things that I don't have an opinion on to be very annoying. If I want to learn about something, I will seek out people who know what they're talking about. However, many people on the other side of the climate crisis, the deniers, will do their best to convince you to come to their side. Thus, it is a slippery slope if we do not alarm people, but I agree with both you and Ken in that people should come to us if they want to learn.

After reading the sections of the book "Bending the Curve", I've found out ways to communicate with others in order to get my point across. One thing that stood out to me was that a beneficial way to speak to people about a cause and make them remember it is to utilize stories and analogies. Personally, whenever people use stories and tell detailed accounts of when they switched to a vegan diet or other ways of saving the earth, I feel myself comparing their experiences to my own to see if I could also do what they did. It's also easy to ask more questions about a story than a fact because usually the conversation ends when someone just explains that the earth's temperature is rising over 2 degrees celsius at this point. But, if it were stories and anecdotes, I am more inclined to ask about the specific events and technicalities about ways to help the environment. I think that analogies are also a good way to bridge between the gap of someone stubborn and someone trying to advocate for the the environment. Analogies allow us to relate to people's interests and make it useful to educating them about the environment.

I agree that the tools that "Bending the Curve" provides for communicating the climate crisis are very useful. While you can spew facts about the gravity of the situation all day, this is not necessarily an effective way to communicate. Using things such as personal experiences to help explain and relate to their audience is a good strategy to use. I have struggled to communicate the things I have learned in this class sometimes and can't just give them the articles that we have read, so finding new methods of communicating is  necessary in order to be more effective.You have to adapt your message to fit the audience if you want to be able to get it across a wide variety of people, which is necessary for the climate crisis since it is a global issue.


<br><hr>
I also share the same experience as you. Prior to reading chapter 8 of this book, I had no idea that communicating on the matter of climate change can be tricky and we need to ensure people get the most of our message. Never would I have thought facts and statistics sometimes would not be the best approaches into conveying people to act. By telling stories we relate to the audience on a more personal level and makes the aspect of communication more interesting. I learned that effective communication involves translation and interpretation of complex information into concise and interesting ways of storytelling for the audience.

When I first saw that this week's reading was a chapter from a book, I was not expecting this. This reading has by far not only been my favorite so far but I think it is really useful. To begin I like how the author focused on certain points in particular that are really beneficial  like stories, science vs myths and metaphors. I also found it helpful that it created really good metaphors like the steroid ones. That one home run may not be evidence of steroids but overall a way better season would mean so. I found this was a really good parallel with CO2, they chapter compared it to the starioid. In this case it is the planet, a lot of CO2 may not make one particular day hotter, but the overall climate is likely to increase. Another point I agreed with was when they compared a climate scientist to a doctor. They stated that no one questions a doctor as much as a climate scientist is questioned.
                          <br><br>


But the part about this reading I liked the most was Uncle Pete. Although I did not like this character at all it was very true that I infact know a pete, who has stated the exact same things. The examples that were mentioned like warming is due to orbital change is one I’ve heard so many times before. To be honest I had a conversation like one with Pete over thanksgiving with my uncle. He was spitting out statements that I knew were false but whenever I tried to say no… his ears automatically closed. Another example that my uncle said was that volcanoes emit more CO2 than humans, when he said this I knew it was not true. But I did not have the facts that I do now. Now I can say that humans are 100 times more. This chapter is really helpful in learning the answers to all the statements deniers say.

I agree with you, Layne, this reading has also been my favorite so far. From reading some of the other comments, it seems that many people found this to also be their favorite. Not to discredit our other readings, as those have also been very important to the overall understanding of the climate crisis along with informing us on all of its many aspects. However, I think what makes this week's reading so important is the “uncle pete” example that the author uses to advise us on how we should approach conversing with people who don’t believe in climate change about just how serious of an issue it really is.
                          <br><br>

Although I also did not like uncle pete's character, I must admit, he very much resembled some of the few people I know who continue to deny climate change being a real thing. One of these people includes my own dad. He has always seen climate change as something nonexistent, something that is nothing to be worried about. Taking this class has truly changed any of the opinions I had on climate change prio, especially those of my dad’s that he convinced me to be true. So far I have learned the information about climate change to inform my dad on, but now after this week's reading, I understand much better how I should actually be talking on this topic with him.

<br><hr>
I thought the Uncle Pete character was an interesting way of giving an example of a person to communicate about climate change with. I thought that it was a little harsh on poor Uncle Pete and that climate change skeptics might be offended at the description of them. Then I realized the target audience of this textbook; it’s written for people who already believe in climate change who need to communicate to those who don’t. And the Uncle Pete description very well may resonate with people who struggle with skeptic relatives.
                          <br><br>
I think that one of the most important pieces of advice that the author suggested for decent communication is to use language that is understandable for one’s target audience. Often I see articles about climate change that are just out of my realm of understanding. They use units that aren’t comprehensible to me or terms that are confusing because they have different meanings in scientific terms and casual terms. I had a friend in high school who was on his speech and debate team and had a really elevated vocabulary, and when he would talk about political issues or societal problems, sometimes I just couldn’t follow along because I wasn’t on the same level as him in terms of language. I think climate change activists and writers would be more effective if they were able to communicate on the same level as the general public.

Out of all the readings we have done for this class, I perceived this week's chapter about communicating the climate crisis as one of the most important ones. Eight weeks into the quarter, I can say with confidence that I understand the issues and reality of our climate crisis pretty well and can list several things I want to change about my everyday life. When it comes to me personally, I'm pretty much sold. I stopped eating meat, I choose nondairy milk alternatives if available, I rarely eat eggs anymore, I only buy clothes if I really need them and I use public transport and my bike as much as possible. Now that I am so convinced about all of these lifestyle changes, I often find myself questioning people's morals or actions if they don't do those things. Even when it comes to my friends, I have noticed more and more environmentally damaging behaviors in them and constantly wonder how I could educate them about their detrimental actions. In the fear of sounding like a judgmental know-it-all, I often don't say anything. And even if I do, I struggle to express my thoughts and often fail to come up with convincing arguments. I don't know anybody in my immediate circle of friends or family members that deny the existence of climate change, yet, most still refuse to stop eating meat or take the bus instead of their car. When I call them out on their behavior, I hear responses like "I'm sorry, I just love steak too much" or "Well, I need to get there fast, so I'd rather drive my car". 
                          <br><br>
This is why I was particularly happy about the assigned reading this week. Learning how to effectively communicate the facts about the climate crisis is probably one of the most important tasks of any person that believes in the reality of climate change. Changing our own behavior and lifestyle is one thing, but I see it as equally important to educate others on what they could be doing. Reading about what specific language to use, what kind of metaphors to include, and how to debunk common myths about climate change was, thus, especially interesting. Additionally, this lecture has taught me the definitions of "freegans" and "climatarians", two terms I will definitely be using from now on. I believe that one of the reasons why people are so hesitant to switch to a plant-based diet, stop using cars or planes, and buy less unnecessary clothing, is that it is "simply too much and they can't do it all". Well, you don't have to do it ALL. I think baby steps are a lot more realistic than completely cutting out all animal products from one day to another. Barely anybody is able to do that. Instead, you can start by cutting out meat. Then fish. Then milk. Then eggs. And boom, there you go. Vegan. 
                          <br><br>
What I am trying to say is that everything seems a lot more manageable if you break it down into smaller steps. And if you realize that you cannot bring yourself to stop eating eggs, then that's fine too. You're still tremendously reducing your carbon footprint by all the other animal products you cut from your diet. The same goes with everything else. I, as an international student, am simply not able to stop flying on a plane. That's okay. There are other ways I can help the environment. We don't all have to do EVERYTHING. But we definitely have to do SOMETHING.

I love your positive attitude! I especially like how you promote the idea that anyone is capable of helping! It's quite motivational, especially for someone like me. I've been very reluctant to change my diet, but after reading your comment I'm ready to try harder and/or find even more ways to help out. 
                          <br><br>

The idea of effectively communicating about the climate crisis in "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" reminded me of an idea from the "Being the Change" film. One man in the movie said "If you reduce your emissions that’s good but if you don’t let the world know you’re doing that… [then what's the point?] if you’re an artist make art about it… if you’re a musician make music about it… if you’re a writer write about it”. Oftentimes, people say "practice what you preach" but in the case of spreading awareness about the climate crisis and getting more people to do their part in combatting it, it's also important that we "preach what we practice."
                          <br><br>

I think you do a great job preaching what you practice! You have great tips!

<br><hr>
This is a wonderful response and I agree whole-heartedly with you. I think people get too caught up in the idea that their transition to a climate-friendly lifestyle has to be immediate. While yes, that would be ideal if everyone could switch instantly, it's just not realistic. Sadly, people seem to just back out entirely when they are overwhelmed. They tend not to make these little changes that could reduce their climate footprint significantly. However, if we were able to communicate with people that it doesn't need to be instant, then we would most likely see the little steps that you were talking about. That is why "Bending the Change: Climate Change Solutions" is such an important reading. 
                          <br><br>

The most important part about the reading, to me, is how we can see Ken use the methods in his own class. Ken uses metaphors and specific language to convey his message to his audience. From my own personal experience and what it seems like based on others' comments, it seems to convey his message successfully. He has provoked action from his audience, despite the fact that some people are probably hearing the same message over again, just in a different way. It goes to show how the way you communicate something is very important -- especially for a topic as touchy as climate change.
<br><hr>
Thank you so much for your comment! I'm glad I can encourage you to make some changes in your habits. 
                          <br><br>
I really like the example you used from the movie we watched this week. I totally agree that spreading awareness and educating others about our climate is one of the most important things we can do. I guess this is something that I also still need to work on. This is why I loved the reading and film this week so much! It really helps you understand how to communicate the climate crisis to others. Plus, the movie gives an excellent example of how a more ecofriendly and sustainable life could look like!
                          <br><br>
But thank you for your kind words!
<br><hr>
Thanks for your comment! I really agree with what you said - people are often overwhelmed by all the changes they "need" to make when in reality, nobody expects you to completely change your life from one day to another. I think that this is often used as an excuse to do nothing at all. It's really a shame that so many people completely miss the point of it all.
                          <br><br>
This is why this week's reading was so important! Communicating effectively about our climate crisis is essential in order to educate others. I still struggle with this and I often feel like I'm not able to express my thoughts clearly enough.
                          <br><br>
And you're right, Ken has really been able to articulate clearly what the climate crisis is and what we can do about it. I never thought I would learn so much in this class! Ken really inspired me to educate others as well.

This week’s reading, “Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions,” took a different approach in tackling the climate crisis than any other readings we’ve had throughout the course. Many of the past readings have largely been pessimistic and seem to dwell in the catastrophes of the climate crisis, and therefore I truly appreciate the author’s optimism and attention to the importance of communication in educating people about anthropogenic climate change. The assigned chapter detailed particular solutions that the reader may be in when faced with climate denial, as well as provided the reader with a strong foundation in proper communication of the issue at hand. As exhibited by the partisan divide currently delaying action toward battling the climate crisis, scientific facts are no longer the most important piece of the argument when it comes to swaying someone’s opinion. While facts are essential to the reality and science of climate change, how these facts are communicated are even more important. The reading this week did a great job explaining the best ways to educate someone about the science of global climate change, as the author provided the reader with multiple ways to present information in a way that was easy for anyone to understand and accept.

I really agree with you. Have you ever tried to start a discussion with an Uncle Pete? If the baseline is that he discards scientist because he either doesn't understand the statistics or has decided the arguments are a little too solid to attack, you are stripped of your best ammunition to use in the discussion, the facts. This is where other forms of persuasive communication come into play. This chapter, as you said, did a great job of highlighting the most common fallacies and pseudo-arguments and how to refute them. Although imo it could have been a little more about really convincing somebody rather than just countering their argument. I think if we manage to show the Uncle Pete's of this world that they do have a huge stake in avoiding climate disasters and showing them that they are real by for instance making them see that their kids will be affected by this (just a random example, of course not every uncle Pete has kids) we could have a great impact on the number of people that believe the climate crisis is real. And by mobilising more people we can eventually insinuate political change by addressing this with a big Climate Lobby.

I strongly agree with your point on the importance of being able to relay credible facts and statistics about the climate crisis to other people, both skeptics and supporters alike. The article "Bending the curve: Climate Change Solutions" did an excellent job at explaining how scientists sometimes aren't the best at explaining the connections made between their scientific journals and the layman's colloquialism. There is a huge educational gap between climate researchers and the general public, and as these researchers increase their skills of writing scientific journals, they lose their ability to effectively communicate this to their less educated audience, which is quite unfortunate. The whole importance of these journals is to inform the public, and although what they have stated may be correct, it is virtually unintelligible for the the average Joe to comprehend. In addition to scholars, we too can use the advice given in the readings in our own lives as we try to spread environmental consciousness to our friends and family members, like "Uncle Pete". The many ways the author presented were interesting, and I was wondering if you have any other ways or techniques that you would use I you were trying to make someone change their view on the climate crisis?

I feel you! I was actually surprised when I saw the title of the reading since we were basically talking about the climate issue itself for the past weeks. Chapter 8 of “Communicating Climate Change Science” is very well-organized and easy to read. I love how the author makes a logic order of communicating tools that we can use when talking about climate issues. Instead of simply listing our strategies, the author provided a lot of detailed examples to help the readers to better understand the concept, which was good. Although the book is a UC publication, it’s not as hard and tedious as other academic articles. For this reason, this book will be easily accepted  by people in different age ranges and with backgrounds, which means it can “educate” people efficiently.

I completely agree with you and think that you mentioned the key lessons that I got out of the reading and video. I also enjoyed that this took a more optimistic approach on the climate crisis and how to lead by example in a manner that won’t overwhelm or make someone feel bad about it. To not initiate the conversations regarding the climate crisis makes sense with the idea that you should wait until the other person is really ready and wants to learn or else they most likely won’t have a open mind to hearing what you have to say or will take it in another way than what you were meaning it to be. I really enjoyed the idea of being a climatarian because it is both something to spark up a conversation (since it’s not a well-known word) and demonstrates how you don’t have to eliminate all things just choose better options that would help the environment. I truly think that most people won’t switch over to a vegan diet or go along with the green new deal because they feel forced into doing something whereas the climatarian lifestyle allows one to make their own choices just with the environment in mind. I think once this becomes normal then we will have an easier transition to the plant-based diets. Here it demonstrates that ‘welcoming bridge’ and people will most likely follow by example if it’s put in a welcoming manner. I agree that one has to change themselves first before they can change the world; so I am changing to a climatarian and will venture upon the questions asked when I give that answer.

I too very much appreciated the approach in this chapter. Scientists and even college educated people are very lucky people compared to most of the world and country. Therefore, when experts get too wordy, it’s a major turnoff for the general public. Scientific literature is intimidating, even for experts, so how do we think the general public feels? There is a disconnect between the general public and scientists relaying information of the climate crisis. Thus, communicating needs some altering. The author relaying the information must prep well; this includes knowing the general principles of the audience members are, knowing yourself, and knowing the most common myths. Another important aspect in engaging the audience is the use of stories. Stories are personal and for that reason, people are more likely to empathize. This is the same tactic as activists. Language is important as well. Scientific jargon should be thrown out the door when talking to the public. Additionally, including information on solutions is imperative. We need to remind ourselves that science has its own high standards, but it is self correcting. 
                          <br><br>




What upsets me the most is that people think that I perceive them as moral failures just because I am vegan. We all have to start somewhere and there is not one path to follow. The climate change myths and falsehoods that Uncle Pete believes in have been refuted many times over. So if you follow the steps in how to communicate, then maybe we can make a bigger change in cultural values. The goal in this is to inform people. We want to motivate them. We want them to act. The biggest unknown about the future climate is human behavior.

I also agree that this week's reading is very good. Different from the previous reading materials, this reading shows us how to solve the problem of climate change that others don't value. For example, when people who don't agree with the impacts of climate change question, how to make them believe that they will not deny what we said at the beginning of the dialogue, but make them more willing to listen. This is the main content of this week's materials. He also told us how to use methods to solve the problem in different situations, and others didn't believe it. Although I am not a vegetarian myself, the video of the professor also gives me a good example. For example, when friends ask you about your food taboo, you should not say that you are a vegetarian first, but tell them that I am a liberal, so that friends will be more willing to listen to what you say next, rather than immediately Interrupt the conversation, so I think this method taught in the video is very desirable.

I agree with your point that "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solution" has a different way of educating people about the Climate Crisis.  In early weeks our readings were more alarmist and warned of the deadly consequences of climate change.  I personally like readings like last week "The Green New Deal" which lays a proposal on how we can make a change and this week which details how to educate others on the topics without turning them away.  I come from a republican town so the Uncle Pete section really hit home with me.  I know at least 5 that use at least one of the false claims in the reading and I never could combat their opinions because I didn't know the facts, I just knew they were wrong.  Now I know exactly what I'm going to say and how I am going to react I inevitably have a political debate with one of them over Spring Break.  I think where you say " While facts are essential to the reality and science of climate change, how these values are communicated are even more important."  I wholeheartedly agree because no matter how astonishing the facts are people on the other side won't budge on their stance unless you are convinced and trustworthy in the manner you lay them out for the doubters.  The tips that this reading gives are simple but important like knowing your audience and how important it is to stress that climate change is an issue Now, not 50 years down the road when some of the statistics are saying it's going to turn bad.

I found this week's reading surprisingly helpful. A lot of the other things we have read have been interesting for sure, but this reading stood out for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it addressed the real problem at hand: how to deal with people who submit to the idea that climate change is a bipartisan issue. I liked that the author sort of included all of us in this group; climate change and the aspects of it did not need to be explained, but rather how to communicate those ideas were addressed. Secondly the author focused on several different aspects of idea communication such as language, presentation, and the importance of being willing to have a conversation versus knowing all of the facts.
                           <br><br>

This reading felt very point blank and straight forward. I appreciated the author's willingness to be upfront about the complications that arise when having an argument. It's okay to not know everything, stay calm and focus on points that the opponent will be swayed by, and overall be willing to have that conversation. The reading felt de-cluttered and it was nice to not be bogged down by climate information and rather to have a strict focus on the topic at hand: communicating climate change.



<br><hr>
The author's forward optimism is also the first thing that I noticed. I appreciated how the author mentions how imperative it is for scientists to begin their stories and documents with a hooking "lead" that grabs readers' attention. It makes the reader want to continue reading. They also include that this is so important yet simple that it applies to even common conversations we are having with people, in person. Starting a heavy topic out like this can instill a motivating mindset to the audiences. 
                           <br><br>


 Furthermore, I most enjoyed reading 8.4, which addressed language in which scientists speak in when spreading information about climate change.  I chuckled while reading about how scientists are often surprised to hear the public's confusion with the definition of a positive feedback loop. It is human nature to associate the word "positive" with "good" and therefore we naturally assume that this phenomenon is a good thing. I too was part of the public that believed it was a good thing until my AP Environmental Science class.





<br><hr>
I agree with you. I enjoyed the optimistic approach of this week’s reading. It gave me insight into how to talk to “Uncle Pete”. There were interesting perspectives on climate change communications like a scientific vs. nonscientific approach. In the end, facts are important despite the constant partisan nature of climate change in our current political atmosphere.
                           <br><br>
Personally, I have not really interacted with climate change deniers in my life. This is likely due to how fortunate I am to have received a great education with the peers around me. I also doubt that I will run into too many “Uncle Petes” in the future either. I doubt there are too many at UCSB and as our generation gets older, climate denial will likely be less prevalent. 
                           <br><br>
Overall, this reading did a great job educating me on how to deal with any potential “Uncle Pete.” I had never really focused on communication as an important factor of dealing with the climate crisis. Previous to this class, I had only really thought of climate change from a scientific point of view. Now I know the importance of other perspectives as well, including proper communication of the issues. If we are able to properly persuade deniers of what they are ignoring.



<br><hr>
I agree with your comment! This week's, "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions," definitely took a very different approach from other readings. Previous readings made me sleepy as I read through them due to the way the author would communicate his/her ideas to the reader. This book taught us, essentially, how to become better at communicating our ideas about climate change to people like "Uncle Pete." We all know someone in our lives that resembles Uncle Pete in some way, shape or form. It's hard to dialogue with this character because of their denial and spreading of fake climate change information to other audiences. Therefore, this book tries to provide a new route for us  to tackle such problem without insulting those who oppose climate change. This was rather easier and more enjoyable read than the other readings. I am 100% confident that the author applied the communication skills discussed throughout the chapter. One particular part I loved the most was that of stories. Instead of overwhelming people with facts and gloomy outcomes, we should tell them stories. Stories are a way to engage with audiences of different backgrounds as everyones loves to hear stories. These stories should be used as an introductory path that will eventually lead to the climate science we want to discuss. It could even be embedded within the story being told! I believe we all should follow what this chapter tried to tell us. Additionally, Ken also introduce to us another way to communicate people, but in this case people that are not skeptics. they believe climate change is real. They believe is here, yet they lack the will to do something about it. However, we cannot just tell this to our friends. It is better to show the through your actions the kind of life you live and where it has taken you. Sooner or later, your friends will start wondering about your lifestyle choices, and at that point you can tell them. Beware, do not try to make them change but rather try to just tell them what you do, and how you did it. After all, we are all just humans with many defects. We are not perfect.

Great comment! I believe we share some thoughts in common. As you said in the comment, “While facts are essential to the reality and science of climate change, how these facts are communicated are even more important”, this reading really gives us some inventive insights about how to inform the public and bring the climate issue to the spot light. In the reading, it gives some examples to the scientists about how to attract audiences. The author claims that the way that those scientists introduce those climate crises to the public is kind of tedious and ineffective. The author think it is better for those scientists to make their claims shorter in order for the public to understand. Also, he wants to use a more interesting way to draw audiences’ attention, such like stories and metaphors. I, personally agree to this article’s idea about the communicating climate change. I think sometimes, the way that scientists communicate all the details and background first and then announces the results and conclusions at the end is less attractive. It is often tedious to read and can attract less audiences. If we want to let people to make actions, first we need to let them to be acknowledged.



<br><hr>
This comment really made some awesome points. First of all, I have to agree with this author, standing out from other Climate Change scientists or producers, hold a good deal of optimism for the future. I like how he uses the analogy “is the bottle half empty or half full?” Yes our planet is messed up, but he also pointed out how there are plenty of creative ways we can implement to help save our planet. Meanwhile, I have to agree that now scientific data and facts are not the aspect that climate scientists have to focus when it comes to spreading the information to the general public. Scientists have to look at the issue from the perspective of the commoners -- will they know what they mean and how would this apply to them. The ultimate goal of the climate scientists right now should be informing the public the reality we are facing while still offering them solutions, and help integrate these solutions as part of their lives. And this manual offers great instructions teaching how they can do so, as it is friendly to both climate scientists and commoners, due to its simple words and easy language. The multi-aspects strategies come in handy not only while addressing climate change, but also other issues scientists want to address to the public.

I agree with you on how the approach was taken this week for our reading, “Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions,” bringing a fresh way to look at the climate crisis. This positive way to approach the climate crisis and how we can apply it to the real world is one of the most if not the most valuable thing that I have learned in this class so far. Using our language, communication and metaphors to teach others how the climate is truly changing will allow me and everyone else in this class how to talk to the other side of the argument. Sommerville was great in providing examples of how to talk to people with his own simple language, expanding on the social aspects that go into the climate crisis issues with human life. I disregarded the argument that people were concerned with how much influence the government would gain from making more policies involving the climate and environment. I now realize after this reading that it is one of the main aspects of the climate crisis social aspect of debating. The use of Uncle Pete was a great way to focus a paper around a topic that is hot and how we should go about it. It will teach us all how to better confront these types of people in our daily lives.

I agree with what you said here. The author's optimism really stood out to me especially compared to our last readings. It also addresses a major issue with the climate crisis: dealing with climate deniers. If people don’t know how to deal with deniers all that will happen is a toxic argument where neither side learns anything. I agree that when it comes to spreading the information to the general public, scientific data and facts are the aspects that climate scientists focus too much on. Instead, they should try to explain this information in a way a common person can understand and then show them how it will affect their situations. The author also proposes using stories to communicate this information and I personally believe this can be hit or miss depending on the listener but it is a good way to get people intrigued in the topic. This will also leave the listener feeling less negative rather than just laying out bland information about an upcoming doomsday if they don’t get their lives together.



<br><hr>
I agree with your evaluation of this week’s reading. Although the detrimental consequences of climate change is indisputable and demanding everyone’s attention, a critical and pessimistic tone may not be the best way to effectively communicate the message. To convey accurate and credible truths and data to everyone, not just fellow environmental activists, we need to do so in a way that doesn’t deter and antagonize anyone from the subject. Therefore, I appreciate the author’s detailed analysis and examples of how to communicate the subjects in a agreeable and personal way. The willingness to communicate and convince rather than debate and expose by the author is well emphasized. Rather than being cluttered with negativity and pessimism, this reading has a direct attention on ways to effectively convey the message. I know from experience that discussion regarding climate change happens frequently with individuals that hold opposing views. Such discussions often escalate into debates which both sides are intent on spewing information with their ears sealed shut. With the tools I gained from this reading, I hope to make these discussions more effective and productive.




<br><hr>
The tone of this week's reading was a pleasant surprise for me as well. Since we consume so much media from this class, it's easy to feel discouraged when we see cases of those who believe anthropogenic climate change is just a hoax - and we've seen this constantly throughout our films and readings. So, I also really appreciated the author's efforts to stress how important clear communication and language use would help with educating others about climate change. And though I suppose it should be expected from an article about this subject, I appreciated how accessible and understandable the content of this reading was. I feel like articles that use a lot of complicated language are unaccessible to a large portion of readers.




<br><hr>
I thought that the author's approach was simple, optimistic, and realistic. Like you, I also appreciated this approach, as it seemed to make the reader feel more positive about the issue of climate change. The chapter gave effective tools and strategies in communication on this topic - like stories, metaphors, and choice of language. I think anyone trying to become more involved in helping mitigate the climate crisis and spreading awareness should read something like this, because often, knowledge and science alone will not be enough, if you do not have effective rhetoric to communicate the information. Honestly, miscommunication and misinformation seem to be the largest barriers we're facing as a country in mitigating climate change. There are many Americans who believe climate change is a hoax, and do not accept scientific findings. I believe this can be attributed to miscommunication and misinformation. So readings like this week's are important - just as important as our readings which were solely about the science and the facts.




<br><hr>

I agree with what you said full-heartedly and think that the other very pessimistic reading we have encountered in this class do more harm than help. When being exposed to information that basically says the world is ending and only drastic measures can save us, people are more likely to simply give up and have the thinking that there's nothing they can do to the extent that is needed. When the information is given in an optimistic way such as this reading, people are more inclined to believe that there is something that they actually can do. Like you said, the facts themselves have little meaning. The way that they are interpreted and communicated is the real step that needs to be fixed to allow a generalized understanding and call to action in people. 
                           <br><br>
With that being said, I think that this article did a really good job of both portraying solutions and outlining problems that we may not realize are in effect. Learning about solutions for climate change and becoming aware of the way we look at information and possibly change the way we take in the information are two really well-paired sets of positive tasks for the reader to be able to take part in.

This weeks reading essentially broke down the knowledge needed to explaining environmental issues to the general public. I agree that it did do a good job in breaking down the skills and mindset needed to explain such complicated issues. In giving the reader separate points of things needed (Preparation, Stories, Metaphors, Language and solutions) it allows the reader to understand what skills are needed to properly educate someone. I think including how stories and metaphors are often much needed tools of communications is very important as sometimes plain facts are not enough to convince people of your argument. Having a general knowledge on multiple subjects really helps as it can clear up confusion and respond to questions. I think education in the environmental sector is so important.



<br><hr>
I agree, this weeks reading was definitely much more refreshing than past readings and offers extremely useful information that we can use to help inform and educate our friends, family, and even "Uncle Pete". Having taken an introductory class in communication, it was interesting and exciting to see the author mentioning similar strategies as I learned in the class such as being non-confrontational, appear trustworthy/likable, rephrasing/restructuring the wording of your point to fit your audience (whether it be on their knowledge of the subject, political views, etc.), and etc. when it comes to educating others. Ken even gave an example of how to engage and inform others in the video when mentioning how he introduces himself as a "climatarian" (an unknown term that promotes curiosity), instead of as "vegan" (the audience may have preconceived notions or negative stereotypes of how vegans act and what they are like). This small change in wording makes a huge difference in informing audiences and encouraging them to take the same action you are doing. Even beyond the climate crisis, having a mastery of communication skills will take you so far in life and make you very influential among your peers.




<br><hr>
I very much agree with what you're saying here. Though I've appreciated all I've learned in this class, there are times when I've felt more hopeless than motivated about the crisis at hand. Hearing all the facts about how we're too late and we're way worse than we should be are more going to convey the idea that it's pointless to even try to fix it, and that's not what we need. I, too, appreciated the optimistic outlook of this week's reading. Also, "Uncle Pete" was a fun touch to add. I think almost everyone knows an Uncle Pete type person, so I liked that the author addressed how to work with someone like that. Throwing statistics in the face of someone who has heard it all before and already doesn't believe it is going to do nothing. I have long wondered how to go about convincing someone who is set in their ways, and this week's reading was a nice step so I feel ready when the opportunity arises.




<br><hr>
I definitely agree, and found it quite interesting, that this reading was more focused on the communication aspect of the climate crisis. Before reading this piece, I hadn't given much thought to the precise way that information about the crisis may be relayed, but now I understand that this is crucial. I felt the most important ideas about expressing the facts of this issue were, as the chapter explains, to 1. be clear and concise with your wording (just as we all appreciate a straight-to-the-point doctor) and 2. relate the information to the audience's daily life. The latter notion is a key part, as it establishes ethos with listeners, connecting to their everyday normalities. This allows them to notice subtle changes in their surrounding environments that are caused by this climate crisis and to realize the closeness of such issues; it isn't an out-of-sight, out-of-mind situation. 
                           <br><br>

Additionally, it shocked me to read that the military has expressed concern about these global climate issues, as they present as a "threat multiplier."  I hold a stereotype in my head that a great majority of military personnel, especially the higher-ups, were for the most part conservative and sided with the beliefs of such, thus believing the climate crisis is a hoax. However, after reading the concern by the military laid out in the text, it gives me hope that these worries may begin to sway opinions and will cause more people to realize the pertinence of the situation.





<br><hr>

I completely agree with you. I always thought that we had to keep adding facts in order to make people understand or realize the concept of climate change. After reading "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" it made me understand that we have to in a way appeal to our audience. While the facts might be obvious to us, for other people, the basic facts create a depiction that harms them in some way or can be too much for them to even want to understand. I didn't realize  that a large part of denial comes from not being able to properly communicate the important issues. After reading this chapter, it made me realize that we have to get better at being able to communicate these major problems in a way that is providing people with facts,  trying to understand other peoples points of views, and tweaking your points into a manner that allows them to also be able to understand the facts.



<br><hr>
I agree with Leah that in this week’s reading, “Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions,” there was a much more optimistic tone than what we’ve been reading the past 7 weeks. The Author provides facts on how to communicate the issues of climate change and gave proactive ideas about how communication skills, if used effectively, can provide help. For example, while the summary of solutions provides facts about what we are currently doing wrong, “Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions,” provides ways to communicate with others the way you can effectively change your habits in order to stop the issues the summary of solutions lays out. The main points Bending the Curve provides are that you need to go in prepared with knowledge on who your audience is and knowing the facts about climate change. The second thing is having stories to provide to effectively engage your audience. In those stories, including metaphors and academic language is extremely important to be used in order to convey the topic in an engaging, truthful, and relevant way. Lastly, providing solutions is essential for the audience to have information on how they can make a difference in the problem.




<br><hr>

I agree with your point about making scientific information about anthropogenic climate change accessible to those who may not have the prior knowledge to these facts and figures.  Chapter 8 of Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions was very effective in addressing the frequently used fallacies and arguments that come from climate change deniers along with how to respond to such claims.  Statistical facts and figures are to be thought of as tools, how someone uses them to communicate their message is everything in how an audience will perceive them.  Statistics don't lie, but the people who use them do.  This is why it is imperative that people are educated on how such numbers work and how they should be presented in an understandable manner.  I also think a lot of times that the minds behind the science aren't always the best at explaining the science to the masses.  Which is why it's exceedingly important we have trustworthy people who can in a way translate the information to the public in a semi-colloquial way.



<br><hr>
I agree that I really enjoyed the overall optimistic outlook that this author seems to have regarding the climate crisis. I think most people tend to have very, very pessimistic perspectives on how the crisis is going, (because I mean, it can be kind of hard not to), so to have an author who is fully aware of the scale of the issue still have optimism about the crisis and our ability to help mitigate it is really refreshing and encouraging. When authors become too alarmist or pessimistic, it ends up rubbing the average reader the wrong way, even if they accept the facts about climate change as true and believe in it. People like knowing that there's hope, even in situations where it doesn't seem like there would be any. I think climate change in particular is an issue where authors have to balance a really fine line of being just pessimistic enough to make people realize the gravity of the situation, yet retain enough optimism so that people don't feel powerless or drained of hope for the future, and this author seems to keep that balance in order quite well.

After reading the chapter on "communicating climate change" it made me more optimistic about what we can actually do than the other readings. If we speak effectively with multiple stories, metaphors and solutions then people such as "Uncle Pete" would finally realize that they're in the wrong here and that climate change is a huge problem. I learned that it's important to keep things short and to the point because the more an activist or speaker is speaking, the less the audience will listen especially if the speaker does not know the subject matter and doesn't have facts to back up his claims. I find it very irritating that climate deniers such as uncle Pete rely on false information and always try to find climate activists failed attempts to prove that climate change is real just to further their stance. It seems as if they do no research for themselves and are basically bullying people into sharing their ideas. The metaphor that really got to me was the comparison between body temperature and the planets temperature: "Body temperature only a few degrees above normal is a symptom that can indicate health problems that may have serious consequences, the earth works in the same way." It really made me mad because of how true and relatable it is and people are still not seeing the effects of it. What angers me the most is that we knew about this information for so long already and we did not act accordingly. But yeah I totally agree with your stance on the reading, it was easy for me to understand.

I also enjoyed the fact that this week's reading had a large emphasis on communication. Often times, a lot of the material we learn about the climate crisis is mainly focused on the scientific facts or changes we can make. However, I find that it rarely focuses on how we can actually teach the people around us about the climate crisis.  When I try to go back home and share my knowledge with family and friends they tend to ignore what I say. It's not because they don't believe that climate change isn't important, but since they don't understand what I'm saying they don't find it worthwhile trying to comprehend. Also, if whoever I try to convince about the negative effects already has preconceived notions, they will tend to look for mistakes in what I say instead. I'm glad the reading addressed this by stating to be well informed before you communicate the message. Sometimes I will find myself telling close friends and family about things I vaguely remember, but found important, but they have a harder time accepting what I tell them. This is mainly to the uncertainty that lies in me not being confident or completely knowledgable about the subject. It allows them to be able to shut me down, even if I'm potentially right in what I'm saying. Overall this reading was helpful in addressing issues I have encountered when trying to communicate with people about the climate crisis.

I totally agree with your comment! It is a little refreshing that this week’s reading provided ways to be aware of different situations that someone can face when dealing with a climate denier instead of the alarmist toned readings that we have been assigned since Week 1. I appreciated that the author used logic and accurate statistics to provide ways to communicate with others who do not believe that climate change is real. In a society where opinions are sorted into two different parties, it is very refreshing to know that there are people like the authors who understand both sides and give information to alleviate misunderstandings. It felt that the author understood that communication is the key to finding a solution or a common ground and was able to manifest facts that can be used by the readers and others. I think it helps that since the book was under UC publication, more people (especially college students) can easily access this literature and learn firsthand than from hearing false truths from people or the internet.

I agree that this reading was in particularly more interesting than the past readings. It was easy to read and relevant to what I want to get out of this class. I think that influencing others on the climate crisis issue is extremely important and should be a strong take away from everyone in this class. This book is very beneficial for the things that we should know about climate change... the 12 points that the author took away from the 2018 IPCC findings are the extremely strait forward facts that everyone needs to hear. Politicians and scientists are not always the best people at explaining these things although it is those two forces that are extremely important in influencing people. It is therefore up to us to communicate the climate crisis better than it has been communicated in previous years. The facts matter and stories are an easy way to get the points across.

This week's reading, chapter 8 of “Communicating Climate Change Science” was a very basic introductory course on communication in environmentalism. I originally felt that the content of the reading was very obvious and simple, but the fact that it is obvious and simple means that it needs to be restated. It is often the easier things that get overlooked and ignored. I also thought that the ideas that the chapter gives were very practical and fairly easy for anyone to do. There are not enough climate scientists to have them communicate the issue of climate change one-on-one with the public, so the people communicating about the climate crisis are normal people. And this is why the article needs to be easy to understand and fairly simple to execute. People communicating about the science and facts of climate change should be able to access the information easily whenever needed. They should not need to read through dense reports or sort through packed articles for the best things to tell the people around them.
                           <br><br>
Therefore, this chapter was very effective in its purpose: communicating and teaching people how to communicate about climate change. If I was to be one of the readers reading this and communicating it to my family and friends, I'm glad that this chapter is available to teach ordinary, non-experts the information for us to teach others around us.

I agree with a lot of what you said here.  The IPCC could produce the most detailed, accurate, extensive and methodological report of how human caused climate change is a real and present danger, but if it isn't able to be understood by most people what good will it do for them?  The most important aspect of the climate crisis currently is changing peoples minds.  As much as decreasing our carbon emissions or farming in more sustainable ways are essential for mitigating the climate crisis, absolutely none of it will get done without the support of the people.  The problem arises when those people who we need to convince of the severity of the issue are extremely unwilling to hear a dissenting viewpoint.  A study loaded with facts and evidence may be easily ignored, they will say how the facts are incorrect or the scientists are trying to confuse them with misinformation.  If it doesn't capture their interest in easy to understand terms, they will be entirely unwilling to hear its message.
                           <br><br>
On the flip side though if a study is presented in too easy of a fashion to understand it can be criticized as well.  Sacrificing the inclusion of facts, evidence and scientific consensus for a paper that is easy to understand in simple language will lead those same climate deniers to accuse the study of being opinionated and not backing up their claims with evidence.  They will attack it for being propaganda, and of trying to convince them to change their opinions without actually giving concrete reason to do so.
                           <br><br>
It seems like a losing battle, and in many ways it is.  Climate deniers can attack climate activists for being both too scientific or hard to understand, and not scientific and credible enough at the same time.  It is a tactic used to justify denial in any circumstances, and to always find a way to keep their preconceived and incorrect notions.  Fortunately all hope is not lost.  As difficult as it may be, every once in awhile a paper is written so well that it is hard to find complaint with it in either direction, forcing an equally accurate and persuasive argument to come from the other side to rebuttal it (something the climate change deniers obviously will never have, as they are wrong).  The scientific community and climate activist community alike need to strive to meet this middle ground of persuasive argument with factual backing, if we hope to convince the most hardened climate deniers of their wrongness.

This chapter was effective in teaching the reader the facts on climate change and how to communicate the findings with others. Like yourself I enjoyed that the reading was simple and obvious in many ways. The author really made the reading easy to understand by breaking up his article in subsection such as; preparation, stories, metaphors, language and solutions. I learned that when preparing for a scientific conversation, one needs to prepare themselves with facts. Instead of laying out all the evidence, taking the most important facts and repeating them is more effective. I enjoyed the story on Uncle Pete because it demonstrates why many people are skeptics. This anecdote was important because it tells the audience that climate change is not a political issue or a fallacy made up by the government. Climate change is real and it needs to be addressed. Once we know the issue exists, we can do something about it but if we keep denying the facts then we can not proceed with the solutions. 
                           <br><br>

I believe public discussions among peers are really important because the language used between similar people is easy to undersand. I think it is more effective for a friend to educate you on a topic than a scientist who uses big jargon and is ultimately saying the same thing. The reason to discuss climate change is to inform people and motivate them to act on their future. After reading this chapter on communicating climate science, like yourself I feel that anyone is capable of having an open conversation on the topic. Not only does the author help the readers become better communicators but he also gives us the big facts we need to address in our conversation. I really appreciated his approach because now I know what to talk about and how to go about it.

I agree with you as well, as the simplicity that comes through this reading from "Bending the Curve:  Climate Change Solutions", makes the climate crisis situation more appeal to the average viewer, especially those who don't have a greater educational background. For instance, some people can be deterred off by big science and statistics which has been a prominent reason as to why it's been difficult for people to communicate the climate crisis over to others and especially the non-believers as it becomes overly complex and begin to lose there interest and the power of the message due to repeating points most likely that weren't understood at all by the listener. The message and points given within chapter 8, as you stated and I agree to the fullest extent, that is very practical and very easy to follow along the given points, but even then I'm still a little concerned about how the non-believers will interpret them. For instance, The Green New Deal offered a very clear and straight forward deal or plan that would set the United States onto a better track to reaching a carbon zero emission as a nation and embark us onto a better tomorrow for the generation to come, separately explaining the main goals and the guarantees that would fall behind these goals which the average american could understand the basis of, yet the non-believers skewered the information and manipulated it to make the Green New Deal appear as a joke overall to the media and many Americans who saw the media displaying such false allocations against the easy to understand deal. This is the issue I see happening when addressing the topic to the Non-believers, however this is to my own greater opinion and still feel that the given information found in chapter 8 is compelling to grab the attention and even interest of any viewer which I find valuable, yet still some set of judgmental allocation will appear from such will appear in the listener's mind.
                           <br><br>
What I found successful in my own ways in addressing the climate crisis situation with friends and families is bringing it down a level of there own greater interest and comparing the situation to topics they could understand. This for me has been the most influential and understanding way possible that I have been able to bring the message across to others that I know personally.



<br><hr>
 I agree with you that the issue around non-believers still stands. Even if we try to communicate with all five steps that is addressed for communicating climate change science: preparation, stories, metaphors, language, and solutions, there are still non-believers that will deny the facts that are presented to them. The five steps only make it a little easier to bring awareness to people that don't already know and are willing to gain from the this sharing of knowledge. People that are hard non-believers will likely stay that way as they refuse to acknowledge that their beliefs are misguided. Recurrent emphasis of correct climate change science might be useful to persuade them, but it is still hard to completely override the views of a non-believer. 
                           <br><br>
I also think your own way of comparing things in climate change to the audience's level of interest and similar situations is very useful and effective in communications. People will relate to and be more interested in things that they are aware of and relate to, and therefore, would be a good idea for others to implement your method also.

This was one of the most interesting articles that we have read so far. I never thought about how important the way we communicate climate change could impact a person. The article spoke much about using simple terms and understanding one's audience. We need to be precise and to the point and not use scientific jargon that people would not understand. When people start to not understand a concept, they are most likely to be off-put by the lack of familiarity and will not be intrigued to actually listen and understand more. As Ken noted, when he went to a restaurant to order the vegan option, he didn't shove the information on why he was ordering this in his friend's faces. He simply waited for them to ask and gave a simple answer of why it was helpful for him and the environment. People had a positive response and even ordered the choice that would benefit the climate more. This was all possible because of the way the information was illustrated to the people. It was interesting to also learn that just switching from a turkey burger from a beef patty could have such a large impact on helping the environment. I personally had never heard much of Climate arianism until this video; however, I was very open to learning about the concept since it was so casually brought up.

                           <br><br>

 It is also extremely important to include solutions when talking about climate change. No one wants to hear that we have inevitably doomed the Earth as it is very negative and hopeless to hear if nothing can be done. The article gave solutions of how “renewable energy use in many countries is increasing rapidly or how many corporations are now acting to reduce emissions.” These small actions make people feel as though they can do something small that does not have to be extreme to contribute to helping the crisis. We need to effectively communicate climate change to our friends and family so we can all start helping the environment and impede climate change. We want less Uncle Pete’s in the world and more people who are willing to listen and be the change so that the future generation has a world to live in that was nicer than when we received it.

I also never considered how the language we use to communicate about the climate crisis can affect the way someone perceives it if they don’t know much about it in the first place. I agree that the part in the reading about using science jargon is a really big turn off when explaining the climate crisis because it needs to be explained in a way that everyone can understand and not just for the experts that people fear. I liked the restaurant scenario that Ken uses because a simple word can immediately shutdown the conversation and make people uncomfortable. In this case, the best way to talk about climate change is not about the situation itself but about the personal choices we make everyday. 
                           <br><br>

If we talk more about the the way our choices affect the climate instead of forcing people to change their way of life, then they will immediately resent the subject and turn away from the crisis at hand. I also agree with you in the sense that this article provides simple steps towards the solutions that are not extreme but do initiate the change that will make a difference. Personally, I have been employing a climatarian lifestyle for the past 2 months and it has made me more aware of the choices I make and how it will affect the planet in the long run. This has often sparked conversation amongst my family and I’ve gotten a much better response than telling them I’m trying to be a vegetarian. We need to approach this situation with optimism and make it clear that there are simple solutions that don’t necessarily warrant government intervention and that it all starts at home and being aware of the personal choices you make

<br><hr>
It is true that this article is really interesting. This article utilizes simple terms to explain many issues about climate change which I find it is easy to read. I never thought the way of talking can influence other people’s ideas and attitudes to climate change. But it is true, if i am talking with a person about some content I am not familiar with, I would like to listen to the words that I can understand from that person instead of some professional and scientific words that I totally do not understand. If this person keeps speaking professional words and does not explain to me, I would feel sleepy and bored about this topic. After that, I would not have any impression or attitude change about the topic that person talked about.  However, if this person talked in a simple way and gave me some interesting examples, that would attract me and I am able to respond to him/her. So we would have a conversation which would deepen my impression about this topic. Also, you mentioned it is important to mention solutions while talking about climate change. It is true, if we just talk about the the negative influence of climate change, it would only threaten the audience. But at this time, it is the best time to let them change a little for the climate crisis if we can provide one small solution.

I like what you had to say about this week’s reading Melanie, it is really interesting how the way we talk about climate change can change the way a person perceives it. I on the other hand already knew that the way one communicates something determines how it impacts them. You are right it is important to keep it quick and simple, but you also need to know who your audience is. If you are talking to a group of kids then of course you are going to want to use simple words and pictures to help explain, while with adults with some sort of scientific background you can get more into the scientific aspects to get their attention. I agree Professor Hiltner’s example of ordering vegan at a restaurant is a good way of letting those around you know more about your decisions in a nice easy way in order to get more positive reaction. I also have never heard the term Climatarians until this video, but I am extremely happy Professor Hiltner mentioned it because I recently became one without knowing it! I decided to slowly cut out meats like beef that are terrible for the environment, as well as choosing meat like turkey bacon instead of real bacon when I’m eating out or grocery shopping. Eventually I hope to cut out all meat from my diet, but until then I am glad I finally found a term I can tell people to help explain how I choose to eat and why. 
                            <br><br>

It is important to talk about our life choices whether it is being vegan/vegetarian, climatarian, or freegan because it helps educate more people as well as getting these terms out there so eventually everyone knows what they mean. The more facts we can get out there the more people will start switching their lifestyles to one of these more environmentally friendly options.

I think your comment on the reading and the video is pretty insightful. You mention that the article we read is one of the most interesting one you have ever read. I share the same feeling with you. The reading discusses how the way of communicating with people could impact their opinions about climate change. Before reading the article, I never consider the way of communication as an important aspect in the discussion of climate change. “When people start to not understand a concept,” according to you, “they are most likely to be off-put by the lack of familiarity and will not be intrigued to actually listen and understand more.” The way that information was conveyed to people is far more important than I previously thought. In your comment, you also mention the significance of solutions of climate change. The article provides some small actions we could do to “make people feel as though they can do something small that does not have to be extreme to contribute to helping the crisis.” According to you, “we need to effectively communicate climate change to our friends and family so we can all start helping the environment and impede climate change.” I believe our effective communication with others will finally strengthen people’s consciousness of solving the climate problem.

Ken's assessment about being not wanting information shoved down their throat is correct. This goes for anything even including the issue of climate change, however as Ken states talking someones ear off is not often the best way to get them interested in what you are talking about. I agree with what you said in your comment about the importance of understanding your audience. Neither party is going to benefit on the topic of climate change if both parties aren't willing to see the other persons side and resonate with them. This article not only bring ups good strategies in communicating the climate crisis to others but it is also an even broader tool that can be used to communicate topics to people who aren't fully informed on them yet. The key point I got from the reading was that you want people to be interested and urge them to ask you questions, as Ken does in his example of eating at a restaurant. I think the best course of action is for people who are educated on the climate crisis to be open to friendly conversation about it and to not make those who are uninformed the enemy as they only makes them more spiteful.

I also never really thought about how important it is to communicate climate change in an effective manner until I read this article. I still always get shocked when I meet an “Uncle Pete” in the real world, because the evidence supporting anthropogenic climate change is just too hard to deny. I am happy this article gave me ways to articulate a specific point or rebuttal to someone who is very set in their beliefs. Scientists often get too carried away with technical terms and data from studies, that a lot of people get too bored or complicated to actually understand the material. I think that climate skeptics try to target the people who are easily convinced using just phrases and unreliable data presented in a simple manner, because they know that a lot of the population is just looking to hear the news they wanna hear. If an “Uncle Pete” is against a carbon tax, then obviously he is going to be more willing to listen to a scientist that is presenting statements in his favor in a simple way, even if that data is unsupported. I also liked the part of the article that stressed we need to prevent solutions instead of just solely instill fear, because people need to be motivated to see that there can be light at the end of the tunnel.
                            <br><br>

As for Ken’s video I also think it is interesting how much word choice comes into play when discussing climate change. I agree with Ken that no matter what side you support, you should never be trying to shove your opinion down someone else’s throat because that will only make them not want to listen to you. I liked his idea of waiting until his friends or family wanted to talk about the subject, because that is when you know people are willing to take in your information and advice. I had also not really heard of climatarianism until this lecture, but I really like the idea of it because I have been struggling to commit to a solely plant based diet. I think starting out eating with the climate in mind and trying my best might be a good segway into eventually adapting a fully plant based diet. We need to help others who may be confused or provided with the wrong information, to fully understand the issues that are going on in this society. And this all starts with effective communication.



<br><hr>
I also found this article a lot more interesting compared to past readings. I think it is very important for people to consider how to correctly communicate climate change problems to people. I think a lot of articles can be too complicated for people and cause  them to lose interest, thus causing them to not completely understand what is happening with climate change. I agree with how you said that when people don't understand the concept, they are put off by it because it is so different. I also agree how we should not just educate about how our planet is doomed and everything will end, but also inform people of how they can work to fix the planet.

This week's reading was clear cut in stating the problems, the facts behind it and the possible solutions. One of the biggest climate change issues does not stem from the environmental distress, but it is the misinformation of many things regarding the climate crisis that fuels the issue. When uneducated, the public is easily susceptible to the negative climate change rhetoric that politicians and corporations often use to undermine how serious of an issue climate change really is, sometimes revoking the issue altogether. The article emphasizes that persuaders should refrain from using such dense and convoluted language. When reading something that has overly-complex wording, most people just lose interest and fail/do not attempt to understand what is being said; this is more true when listening to someone speak as people can read at their own pace, but if they can't comprehend what someone is saying, then the whole message can be misinterpreted. Even if it means using more colloquialisms, scientists should attempt to write more simply as this will effectively get the message across.

                            <br><br>

I feel like this is what Ken does when he teaches. He speaks objectively in stating the facts about climate change, but when he presents his opinion, he does not use deceit or any such tactics that these politicians use. His lectures are always concise and can be understood by anyone. Also, Ken always provides a number of solutions to these environmental problems on both an individual and social/cultural level. Many times climate change scientists will bombard us with the facts about an issue, yet offer no solution. Of course, there are somethings we can do that goes without saying, but it is almost arrogant to believe that everyone has the same level of education as us, especially when it comes to climate change as it is a topic that is not really prominent in a basic academic curriculum.

Communication is a very vital skill in socializing and interpersonal interactions. Humans are social animals. Our actions and speaking will affect other people. Language is a powerful weapon. It has the power to alter people’s mind and opinion. I totally agree with the passage that choosing the language we used is very critical in persuading people. Language is magical. If you use different style of tone and language to explain one single opinion or issue, people will have different feelings and attitude toward them. I agree with what Ken says. Directly implanting the idea of being a vegan or climate activist is not helpful and might cause opposite effect because people might think that you are forcing them to do something and controlling them. The better way to promote the idea of environment conservation is talking in more anecdotal ways or explain to people when they have the desire to know more about it. For someone who acts like Uncle Pete, you can’t just simply tell him that his idea is completely wrong. You can patiently show some concrete facts and examples to persuade him, even though this process might be long.

I've always known that communicating about issues like climate change requires a strategic plan to ensure its effectiveness, but I had not thought about it in the specific example of Ken describing himself as a climatarian vs. a vegan. Reframing how he describes his eating habits without the stereotypes that people are well aware of in terms of veganism allows for the conversation about eating to start. It reminds me of the narrative of how vegans absolutely love talking about how their vegan online all the time, prompting the common response "We get it you're vegan!" Paying attention to how people tend to respond to things like this is important when bringing up these topics in discussion. A couple of my friends are convenience vegans, where if we all go out to eat and there aren't vegan options then they will eat whatever is the least damaging to the environment. This negates the issue of having to go to different places to suit everyone's needs, as well as providing them a greater sense of choice and less restriction. People like Uncle Pete who do not listen to anything related to this issue remind me of a couple of my family members who do not understand why climate change is becoming an issue because it has warmed and cooled throughout our planet's history. There's simply nothing much I could do to educate them, as it seems like a waste of time if they are set in their beliefs. I wonder if there's any way to reach people like this utilizing what we have learned about communicating the climate crisis, or if they are simply lost causes.

I actually went through a whole phase in high school where I did yoga every single day and I tried to convince my friends and family to start to meditate more. Of course they all were very happy for me and they were glad to see how positive doing yoga/meditating was for me but nobody actually took in any of my suggestions. In fact, many of them got tired of hearing me go on and on about yoga, and, as Ken talked about in this video, I eventually just stopped bringing it up to them because I realized that, by me saying all of these things, others were only going to feel annoyed about yoga. And these actions would eventually affect me by unintentionally pushing people away. I think that we as environmentalists have to realize that the more that we push “caring about the environment” with people that we are close to, the more that those people (who aren’t already environmentally conscious) will think that the whole environmentally-conscious movement is annoying and over-the-top.
                            <br><br>

I would love to become a climatarian and I feel like this is probably the best option for our society as a whole. Or, at least, the best way for meat-eaters, to slowly make the transition over to becoming a full vegetarian. It’s much easier to try to choose foods that are more climate friendly than simply outlawing foods like “meat” in your diet. If we frame the climate change moment in a way that makes people WANT to join the movement then we will be able to reach people that we would have never thought would ever want to join the climate activist movement.

My favorite part of this lesson and video is how Ken explains how he communicates basically his life and how he does his part in climate change. Like Visala gave as an example above, just bringing up out of the blue and talking too much about something can actually have a very detrimental effect instead of the positive effect that is intended. Action is a very effective communicator, and by being the change you want to see in the world and not over-the-top broadcasting it to the world, people will naturally come to ask about things like climatarianism or yoga and meditation. Regarding the climate crisis, no one wants to have a bunch of climate change information spewed at them out of nowhere - it would have an annoying and therefore detrimental effect. Being an effective climate communicator is a very important skill in our age - and the reading for this week was very helpful with this skill. I really liked how the reading was saying to keep it simple. The climate crisis is a very complex situation, and it is easy to get caught up in these details. A simple message is the most effective way to convey what the climate crisis is and what we can do for it. Also, the fictional "Uncle Pete" character the text describes is a great example of how to deal with climate-change deniers and to present them with facts about the crisis. Becoming the change you want to see in the world and being able to communicate it effectively are extremely important ways to influence the world and the way the climate crisis will be solved.

I have been vegetarian now for almost three years and I try to talk about it as little as possible. There is this shameful feeling I get when I'm at a friend's or a family member's house and they offer me food that I have to turn down because it has meat. I live with a fear that I'm going to be perceived as entitled or difficult because unfortunately, a good majority of the world does not understand the moral conflict I feel from eating meat. I feel as though I don't want to talk about this because just as Ken said, I don't want to feel alienated or judged for the choices I feel are right. I completely agree with your comment that those who are not already environmentally conscious may find my choices or others like it to be too much and obnoxious. 

                            <br><br>

I agree with you and Ken that becoming climatarian seems like the best option for our society. A big reason that becoming vegan and vegetarian is so unappealing to some people is because it feels like your freedom is getting revoked. With these titles, you are limiting yourself and I think this makes people feel trapped. That is why climatarian is such a great term because those who don't want all the restrictions are still able to contribute to climate-healthy eating in a more easy-going way. When people freely choose options mindfully, it keeps those who are normally turned off by the intensity of this movement moving in the right direction.

I absolutely agree that being an effective climate communicator is a super important skill in this day and age. In order to streamline the environmental movement, we should choose speakers for our movement, people who are good orators and are easy to relate to. Combine someone like this (or some few people like this) with nonviolent but serious action from the people involved in the environmental movement and this is how we will be able to positively influence the American public (and the whole world).

I’m so sorry to hear that you feel like you have to hide the fact that you are vegetarian! But I can completely understand how you feel. I’ve known many people who think that vegans/vegetarians are stuck up and think that they are better than the rest of us because they are ”more trendy” or something similar. I’m sure that a few vegans/vegetarians are like this, but I honestly believe that vegans/vegetarians are just trying to be healthier for themselves and our planet and I really commend you on your effort to stop eating meat (beef in particular).

I really do enjoy learning about communication of the climate crisis. I feel this is excruciatingly important for all people concerned about the climate crisis to learn how to maneuver their way through a conversation about it with others. In order to have the most effective influence on other people regarding the environment, we need to hone in on our communication tactics. If you say one wrong thing, it could entirely spin your conversation into the wrong direction. I think communication plays a big role in spreading awareness, and the ways you approach communicating about the environment are very important as well. I have an "Uncle Pete" in my life and I find it extremely difficult and frustrating to have a conversation with them. I'm constantly faced with the challenge of trying not to get upset when I'm speaking to them. It's really difficult when you are faced with a person who is beyond ignorant and closed minded. I'm still trying to learn how to effectively communicate my concerns about the environment with this person and others like them. I think it's sad that we have to be "careful" about what we say when we're discussing the climate crisis because the other person could shut down so easily, but it's what has to be done in order to make your points clears and open up room for peaceful conversation. I think if there is anything I need to improve upon in my endeavor to fight the climate crisis, it is the preciseness of my communication of our climate goals and the environmental concerns I have. I need to focus on not becoming frustrated in a situation like those that include "Uncle Pete." It's clearly important because in order to raise awareness we need to avoid having the other person shut down before you can even explain your reasoning, but this is so hard to avoid with people like that. I definitely will be continuing the enhancement of my communication skills after this class.

It is great to be given access to better forms of communicating the climate crisis to others who are non-believers and even believers. There are many people who do care, but the science or what data is put out can be confusing at times. The people who put out the information know it very well, but scientists are well versed in science and not public speaking. Dealing with an "Uncle Pete" has it's obvious obstacles and frustrations as being a climate change denier creates more issues for our society. This reading was very intuitive and made for a deep read and I feel like others should see it, just that many would possibly not even read it all as it made for a long read (people tend to have short attention spans). I feel it's best to also put out more information in the public school education system for high school, middle school, and older elementary school students. Getting to people when they're young creates a generation who could overturn the system and implement a need for change as they are the ones who will continue to live on this Earth. For us college students who are still learning and trying to bring attention to the subject matter it can be rough due to other responsibilities, but not impossible. There are many ways to be an activist that doesn't just involve going to the protests, people can share a link for a petition or write to their local and state legislation, just so many options and for those who could care less, we have to move past them in order to keep up the fight.

In the reading, I learned how to communicate about climate change and how to explain the solutions on how to improve climate change. In addition, there are different ways on how to emphasize about climate change and ways to engage with the audience. There are multiple solutions that the reading gives and  distinguishes the problems caused by climate crisis by stating, “It’s us. We’ve done the detective work. It’s not natural like ice ages. It’s human-caused.It hasn’t stopped. The warming is continuing. The warmest years on record are recent years.The heat is mainly in the sea. Over 90% of the heat added to the climate is in the oceans.Sea level is rising globally. The rate of this rise is increasing. The rise is not uniform globally.Ice is melting. Ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica…” It also emphasizes how trusted messengers have a bigger impact since they are well known and trustworthy by stating, “Trusted messengers can have an enormous impact and can motivate people to bring about change.climate change is fundamentally a moral and ethical issue…” It also distinguishes how the metaphor and peer review is used when explaining the dangerous cause of the climate solutions and ways to inform the audience before it is too late.This also emphasizes how to get accurate information and be more informed how to determine if it is actual information or it is false. This reading is very informative since it gives more information and navigate ideas on how be more aware of what information is trustworthy and educate yourselves to determine what is actually going on with the world.

"Climate change is much more than a scientific topic." This is absolutely true.
                            <br><br>
This reading was extremely interesting and enjoyable; I thought that this reading brought up unique points and perspectives that I never thought about, and taught myself new methods on how to discuss about the climate crisis to those who deny it. 
                            <br><br>
There were many good points that were made, but one of them was about how confronting the issue is a moral and ethical issue, as we should be discovering ways on how to prevent our descendants from dealing with a damaged planet. It's really unfortunate that we became "prosperous" by using so much energy, yet we forgot that our home is deteriorating day after day due to our actions. 
                            <br><br>

Regarding Uncle Pete, I agree with the idea from the reading that we need to have more conversations with climate change deniers. Chances are, according to the reading, many people deny climate change because they are using their rejection as a disguise for other reasons, such as political gridlock or domination. It obviously isn't a scientific debate, because 97% of active climate experts agree with the consensus that the climate crisis is not a hoax; scientific evidence itself also points to this conclusion. When we are conversing with the climate change deniers, the reading explained that communication skills are important, and it is good to consider who the audience is to effectively convey the message on the crisis. In addition, it is crucial that we show that we are interested in their perspectives and what they care about. 
                            <br><br>
Overall, this reading was enjoyable as it presented newfound and unique perspectives on the crisis, as well as how we can approach those who are less aware or deniers.

Just as it did for you, the first statement that really stood out to me in this reading was “Climate change is much more than a scientific topic.” As Ken has mentioned in some of his previous lectures, most of the people that are in control of our planet and have the power to implement large-scale actions against the climate crisis are in a generation that will not be affected as much by climate change. I agree that in this sense, climate change is largely a moral and ethical issue and that it comes down to what that generation feels like their moral duty is to the generations that come after them. Additionally, as with the example of Uncle Pete, for some climate change deniers, their view on the topic has more to do with their belief that climate change is an excuse for the government to gain more power rather than their belief that the science is not real. In this aspect, I believe that the reading did a really great job in explaining how to have a conversation with people who will not be convinced by solely the science. One of the best arguments the reading proposed was to explain that if the climate crisis did get worse, there would be more of a reason for the government to get involved (versus if we acted now, we would be able to prevent this from happening). This is definitely an argument that I will be using in the future.


                            <br><br>


I also really liked Ken’s approach to talking about issues regarding the climate change. I agree that often times when people talk excessively about a topic that they believe in, they end up pushing people away from wanting to learn more about it. I think Ken’s idea of waiting for people to want to talk about it themselves and ask their own questions is a much more effective tactic and one that can result in actually helping people slowly change their lifestyles.

After reading the “Communicating Climate Change Science” and watching Ken’s video,  I deeply realize the importance on communicating this issue with other people besides our own actions. Both the reading and Ken mentioned specific communication strategy, including preparation, stories, metaphors, language, and solutions. The reading’s metaphors are vivid and effective in my opinion: Human activities are now a dominant factor in controlling climate change, just like the way thermostat works in our houses. Besides, another metaphor indicates that the rapidly increased CO2 is the steroids of climate and the odds are higher now for all sorts of extreme weather. It works in a similar way as a bicycle racer on illegal drugs who increases his change of winning. Using these metaphors can help people have a better and clear understanding of the severity and the reality of climate change. The reading provides me a general guidance about how to communicate with the general public and try to mobilize more people to act.
                            <br><br>

    Ken’s video is more practical and useful for my real life experience. He teaches us how to communicate action to people who are not skeptics, such as family and friends. I learned that the best thing is not to initiate talking about the climate crisis through Ken’s own example which contrasts his experience announcing that he is vegan with announcing that he is climatarianism. Different with the word “vegetarian” which often shut down the conversation, he word “climatarianism” can be seen as a welcoming bridge that everyone can sip on. Like freeganism, it is not an either/or lifestyle choice, instead anyone can make freedom choices throughout the day. For many people who don’t have much scientific and systematic knowledge about the climate change, we who equip with relative comprehensive knowledge should be patient and wise when guiding them to the first tentative steps in participating in mitigating the climate crisis.

Hi, Chenxiao I also now realize the importance of communicating the climate crisis with other people after doing the reading and watching Ken’s video. The reading was very resourceful to how to properly share how to talk to an “Uncle Pete” on how climate change is a real thing. My favorite was figure 8.1.3 which pretty much sums up the climate change crisis in a single photo with quick concise points. I found this to be one of the more fun readings in this class because of how vivid the writer is with his metaphors, stories, and languages. This reading gave the most realistic way to actually talk to someone who does not believe that climate change is a real thing. 
                             <br><br>
I also agree that Ken gives practical solutions for everyday life. I found this video to be more applicable to do compared to the others. Pretty much everyone around me is aware of the climate change problems and it is hard to encourage them to make more environmentally conscious actions. I agree that this video was good to talk to those types of people. The more I hear Ken talk, the more effective I realize he really is. Ken is very aware of how other people feel towards certain things and offers real solutions. For example, Ken continually pushes for us to go for vegan, but this video was the first time he addresses the negative stereotypes. Really liked how he acknowledges how vegans can be perceived as morally higher and people immediately shut them down. It was interesting that he said to instead say that you are a  climatetarian instead of saying vegan. It is also nice for him to mention that not all are purist and stay away from all meat. It is encouraging for him to say that it can be a bridge for people to slowly go into a plant-based diet. It is good that Ken tells us all to wait for people to want to talk to us but we must change ourselves first.


<br><hr>
After reading “Communicating Climate Change Science” I too, recognize the importance of climate change communication, in a society where people avoid the subject entirely. One communication strategy that stood out to me was using metaphors. For example, likening medical science to climate science is a great way to demonstrate how people believe and support almost all medical research and put their lives into the hands of those who have studied medical sciences, yet people have widespread doubts about climate science. Moving forward, when I discuss climate change with an “Uncle Pete” I will definitely utilize this, or a similar metaphor to communicate the urgency of the climate crisis. 

                            <br><br>

On Ken’s comment on climate communication, I too absolutely love Ken’s advice on how to teach others, or just talk about, any given lifestyle choice in regard to the climate catastrophe. I am currently a vegan, and have been only about a year now, yet I have become incredibly passionate about veganism and I am definitely guilty of  doing exactly what Ken told us not to do: shoving my diet choices and reasons for practicing veganism in everyone's face. I have firsthand seen what Ken is talking about, when I tell people about my eating choices, they often look at me like I think of myself as morally superior or they initiate an actual argument about how my diet is unhealthy and I should change my eating immediately. Obviously, this is not the response I hope for when trying to communicate why I chose to become vegan. I also plan on trying out this strategy of telling my friends at the dinner table that I am a “climatarian” to spark curiosity rather than the negative baggage that comes with the idea of entitled and snobbish vegans.


<br><hr>
By taking on the climate crisis from the humanities approach, Ken has been able to significantly change the way people treat the crisis. In contrast to looking to solve the climate crisis technologically like elon musk or politically like AOC, Ken has actually related relevant information about the science supporting the issue to a wide array of students. Thus, Ken is a good example of someone who effectively communicated climate crisis issues to his friends and students. 
                            <br><br>

Moreover, in regard to the chapter on how to best communicate information about the climate crisis, I also found it clever to use the word “climatarian” instead of vegan because not many people have a previous misconception for the word climatarian like many people do for the word veganism. This highlights the importance of language in effectively communicating information on the climate crisis.

First off, I would like to point out that this week's reading, chapter 8 of “Communicating Climate Change Science,” was not only fairly easy to understand but it was very straight to the point which I enjoyed because it made it super helpful. Usually when I am reading articles, journals, or any piece of media source on climate change, these scientists use a lot of technical terms that I am unfamiliar with and makes it harder for me to grasp the concept that they're attempting to come across. I appreciate this week's reading because of this; the author himself, Richard Somerville, even pointed out that scientist should “use units that are familiar to [the] audience” and they should remember who they are are speaking to; “speaking or writing for a nonscientific audience in the United States [we must] remember that metric units will be both unintelligible and graduating to the audience.” Somerville even mentioned how scientists need to understand that their use of vocabulary differs from ours and it can be confusing to us, so they should avoid using certain terms in their works and I completely agree with him. Everyone should be able to have the privilege to understand climate science no matter the education level, that way we can all be aware of the crisis. 
                            <br><br>
I also enjoyed how optimistic Somerville was. He has a great use of language, which made the reading enjoyable to read, unlike some readings that can be pretty dense, making it long and boring. His use of adding a fictional character, Uncle Pete, was clever. He provided us with approaches that should be made to talk to our doubtful Uncle Pete about climate science and hopefully leave a clear message to Uncle Pete that will leave a positive impact in which Pete no longer mistakes climate change as a hoax. Communicating the climate crisis as simply as we can go a very long way in educating the public.

I understand the importance of translating scientific terms & vocabs of climate change into easier, understandable words so that most people can understand, IF the translation translates the truth. It is important to do so because we need more and more people to know that climate change is real, and we need to do something to avoid it. The more people understand, the earlier and easier we can start to take action. Also, this is a good way to explain climate crisis to the ‘old generations’. Younger generations always blame the old generations. We can explain the situation to them, and persuade them to join us to protect the Earth.
                            <br><br>
In another hand, I think we should know some of the scientific vocabs of climate change without translating. We are students who are learning things. We should know what those scientific terms means.


<br><hr>
I also feel quite enjoyable while I was doing this week’s reading assignment by Richard Somerville, which focuses on the idea of communicating this climate crisis issue. I have the same feeling with you that whenever I read scientific articles, I could only understand the severity of the problem from statistics and I usually got confused with the sophisticated jargons. And as I continued reading, it’s hard for me to grasp what the experts intend to convey to audience. This piece is easy to understand while brings out the vital process of solving the environmental problem, that is to communicate with people. I also remember the figure of Uncle Peter who is a denier to global warming, he is a quintessential representative of some individuals among us. The author makes it clear to the readers how these two opposite voices: one refers to the groups who are aware of the urgency of the climate crisis, and the other one who doesn’t consider it to be a big deal, are formed. I also learned how I can effectively communicate with my friends or family members on the severe climate change we are facing now.


<br><hr>

I also enjoyed this week's reading as it tells how we should communicate about climate crisis issues in a pretty straightforward way which is quite easy to understand. The scientific articles have logical reasonings and solid conclusions are always hard to read, at least this is the situation for me, and make people sleepy as reading more of it. This article is written in words that can be easily understand by people barely understand scientific terms and have relatively little chance to read that. From Ken's video, I agree that we should first change ourselves thus we can people around us. And this idea can be applied more than becoming vegan or vegetarian, or being a minimalist or not. Like riding bike to work/school, ordering fewer kinds of meat on the burgers. Every detail can reflect one's value, and if you want to influence others, you need to be the one started to change.



<br><hr>

 I think it is very important for people to know the severe of the climate crisis. The scientific terms may be hard to understand, but they tell the truth. Science is a very serious subject. People cannot use informal sayings to record it because in this way, it will turn into a joke and nobody will take climate change seriously. Climate change is severe, and it is not threatening people. It just wants people to realize that this is a problem and it needs to be solved. Also, for people have university bachelor degree, they should understand what these scientific terms mean. At least they should know to get a dictionary and find out what these words mean.



<br><hr>

I agree with your comment, it was so helpful that this week’s reading was very easy to understand. Something I appreciated about the reading, which you already touched on, was the example of using units appropriate to your audience. I know that I, as a college student, would be considered a more “educated” member of the general public, and even I get confused when scientists present data in meters, kilograms, and Celsius. Using units less common to the specified audience makes people less aware of the severity of the crisis. Additionally, I think that the frequent use of jargon makes the general public believe that science is a sort of “elitist” subject. Oftentimes, it seems that people are wary of scientists because they believe they are corrupt and want to take away their tax dollars and freedoms. Scientists are misunderstood, and likely because their data is presented in a way that is difficult for the masses to understand.


<br><hr>

I agree with your idea about taxing. It’s truth. However, I suggest people study these jargons because the climate crisis is really urgent now. It needs people’s attention and action as soon as possible. Those jargons are hard but they reflect the truth. People cannot be avoided from the truth. The truth may be ugly, but the truth is the truth. Change the reality should be more important than those jargons. Also, those jargons are scientific vocabs that need respect because scientists put a lot of efforts in them. The ultimate purpose is to protect the Earth.
<br><hr>

Hi Chloe, I completely agree with your opinions on how helpful and more enjoyable this reading was. Sometimes I forget how confusing and dense the climate crisis can be. I've had the privilege of learning about it in high school and been able to take courses here at UCSB prior to this one. This article is really helpful because it can apply to so many people. It's a very straightforward way for people that are new to the topic of climate crisis to get a few easy need to know facts. As for me, it was still helpful because I am always talking about climate issues with my parents and siblings. We're all human and sometimes we get so caught up with ourselves that we forget to think about others. The article reminds us that we should always be cognizant of who our audience is and to think about the best way of communicating.   
                            <br><br>
As for Uncle Pete, I think the author's choice of having the character in the article was helpful in a number of ways. I think the author made a really good choice in describing Uncle Pete's background because when it comes to the U.S. discussing politics we automatically hate the person on the opposing side. Uncle Pete has feelings too and some sort of reasoning behind why he thinks the way he does. It's important to consider this aspect of him as well so we can find the most affective form of communication that eliminates aggression/belittlement. I don't think the U.S. will make any progression on the issue until we eliminate the harsh bipartisan aspect of it and also make some sort of mandatory education. I think one of the main reasons we aren't getting anywhere is that people simply just don't know enough about the issue.

I am glad to see that a lot of people are confident that the climate crisis can be overcame. I am confident too. This reading proves that climate crisis can be mitigated. Now, as long as people find solutions and follow them, our future will be safe. We can live on a healthier Earth. There will be less pollutions around us. I think people should know more about the climate crisis, and concern more about the future of the Earth. There are a lot of information that people can read. Some of them are from the book or the internet. People should know more about this Earth because it is the home to everyone.

It's great that your highschool district offered classes for climate change! Unfortunately my school district back home did not offer any climate change courses so this is my very first time taking a course on climate change. Like you said, this article was a very straightforward way in informing the audience, especially those who are new to the topic, about our crisis. That is one of the many reasons why I enjoyed this reading. Although ‘Climate Crisis 101’ is my very first course on climate change, I was still informed about the crisis and the basic facts of it due to my own research. I would watch videos, read articles, and have conversations with my mom about it, but I only knew so much. Taking this course has taught me much more which I am thankful for because now I can help educate those who don't have the privilege to take these courses. I am constantly informing my friends and housemates all the things i've been learning in this class and I know that there is still so much more to learn.

I find it comforting knowing that i'm not the only one who gets confused when scientist present data, because like you said, us college students are viewed as the “more educated members of the public” so it's assumed by the public that we should be able to easily comprehend these metric units which obviously isn't the case for everybody. This doesn't mean that we shouldn't try to understand these scientific terms, if we are able to comprehend them, then more power to us and we can attempt to educate others who are also confused.

I appreciated how informative this article was compared to other articles that went over my head. I definitely have multiple “Uncle Pete’s” in my family, as in everyone on my dad’s conservative, head-strong side. Family dinners have gone south when I don’t get put any turkey on my plate at Thanksgiving or scramble to eat some honey-glaze smothered murdered pig at Christmas. It has always been a challenge to explain why I do not eat meat without coming across as boastful or superior. I see Ken’s point by saying you should address yourself as a “climitarian” or “freegan” but I think this would cause more of a stir and confusion, and not in a good way. 
                            <br><br>
I liked the metaphor used in the reading that said: “carbon dioxide is the steroids of our climate.” This analogy shows how we are continuously amplifying this problem, rather than squandering it. The statistics provided give good reasoning on how to respond to people who deny the climate crisis. I wish people were more understanding of this issue and actually listened to the science behind this global disaster.

I agree in entirety with the second half of your comment here. Admittingly, I myself am not much of a climatarian or freegan but I have an Uncle who is vegan. I believe that terms such as these further alienate the pro change side, making use of these terms distance those who are educated on the issue. I agree with Jess in that that same line struck close to me in that people at times are unknowingly worsening the problem. I do like the idea of climatarianism because it isn't as drastic as the other food plans that have been brought to us. I believe that we can make more of an impact positively in this field if we can just educate the masses.


<br><hr>
I really like how you used "pro change" side, in reference to being a climatarian/vegan/freegan. I have never heard this term before and do think it matches what most people have in mind when they switch their diets to something more sustainable for the planet. Education is definitely an important step in making people more understanding of why others choose to eat certain ways. Maybe if more people knew about it there would be less judgment and confusion, which would make it easier to live this lifestyle.

After reading, "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" I felt more confident in my ability to be able to properly communicate with someone about the climate crisis. I honestly do not have much experience talking with people who are unaware of climate change to try to change their mind, however now that I have done this reading I feel as though I will be able to properly inform someone else. I have been a meat eater all of my life due to a focus on getting bigger and stronger, eventually reaching my sister went vegan over a year ago for ethical reasons and ever since I would always feel a slight amount of guilt whenever eating meat which was not present when I was completely ignorant. As time passed and as I learned more, this slight amount of guilt got much more noticeable, especially after viewing "Game Changers", a film that showed me that all of my athletic endeavors were not only possible through a plant based diet: but optimized. I continued eating meat, but now after taking this class and watching films like Cowspiracy, I noticed after eating meat meals, my anxiety skyrocketed, my energy levels were shot, and my overall level of well being was seemingly obliterated. I still couldn't make the connection, but it seemed as though everything in the universe was telling me to switch over to a fully plant based diet, and I could no longer think of one reason not to. I have been completely vegan for around a month now, and a lot in my life has improved since. Energy, mood, feeling of connectedness and significance, and my strength in the gym has actually gone up. This diet is amazing and I would advocate it to everyone seeking self-improvement- in any facet.

Yes! I have found that having a guideline for how to properly communicate with people about the climate crisis has made it easier and less intimidating to say something and communicate the reality of climate change. Going to UCSB, I have found myself surrounded by lots of people who are in agreement on topics like climate change; I haven't felt much need to discuss this topic much with people who are in complete denial. I felt this way until I went back home to Utah... having only been home for a few hours, I got into a heated discussion with my brother about the climate crisis. He was in complete denial and, like Uncle Pete, thought it of it as a hoax created by leftists in order to garner political momentum. Additionally, being an athlete who worked out a lot in order to get "big," he believed meat was the only way to get the proper protein and sustenance to maintain his active lifestyle. He said literally everything that Uncle Pete had to say and I couldn't help but laugh while reading the article. While I had the facts and all the necessary information to inform him, I didn't exactly communicate it in the right way to get the point across. Knowing how to properly communicate and get your point across without causing tension or awkwardness is just as important as knowing the facts.


<br><hr>
When I did this weeks reading, I started to believe that communicating the dangers of the climate crisis is a very key and very important first step. I have had a bit of experience having conversations with people who deny the idea of climate change. For example, my grandfather (who is a hard-working and lovely man) and I have had debates when talking about the climate crisis. Like many in the generation before us, he has profited greatly on the environment and its resources. My grandpa worked in a high ranking position in an oil company, so he was able to live most of his life in comfort and wealth. Although, everything given to him was from his company profiting off the earth. When discussing the climate crisis with him, he reverts back to the fact that human evolution and technology isnt just something that we cant let go of/slow down. Whenever he brings up these points, its always easy for me to slow down my argument and give in. I always held on to a scientific point of view of climate change, but never really addressed a ethical one.  I feel as if i wasn't very equipped enough to have a drastic and deep enough conversation with him before this weeks reading. I feel if I talked to him again, I could help tackle down the ethical issues (about human evolution) that he thinks are a "problem". 
                            <br><br>
Also was very glad to hear about your change from meat eating to a plant based diet. I also have changed my diet to live more a more sustainable lifestyle. I will definitely agree that the health benefits outweigh any amount of "tasty" meat you can throw my way!

I would consider myself more passionate about the climate crisis and acting on it than the average person so I do feel frustrated trying to explain to some people why I'm a vegetarian and immediately having everything i say discounted because they think I'm trying to tell them how to live their life. Personally, I care because I don't like being part of the problem so I try to reduce my impact as much as I can through lots of compromise, not because I think my actions will save the world or make me a better person, I couldn't care less about other people's decisions. I just want them to know what impact their decisions have. Learning how to communicate that better through this weeks reading was very helpful. It explains that it should be presented as more than a topic of science. It should be presented as "human". It will affect us all and instead of looking at it as something so distant that we can't help we should come to understand that it's as simple as asking ourselves "what kind of impact do I want to have and how can I try my best to have that impact?"

At first, I was nervous that I wouldn't understand anything that the author was saying, but to my surprise I understood everything. The author made everything simple and didn't add in big words that people might not understand. I really do think that communication is one of the most important things for our future, but we cannot overdo it. If we constantly tell people to alter their living habits and that they need to believe in climate change then they won't want to listen. We need to provide them with the facts, answer all of their questions, and be patient if we want them to change.
                            <br><br>
I really liked the use of Uncle Pete. Everyone knows someone like that. Unfortunately, where I'm from several people are like Uncle Pete. Even my sister's fourth-grade teacher told her class that she doesn't believe in climate change. This is why we need to communicate to people that climate scientists are no lying and they have no reason to lie. I think one of the most important points to communicate is the issue of money. People need to know that is more expensive to do nothing and wait until catastrophes strike. They need to know that renewable energy and wind and solar are becoming cheaper. We should also point out the fact that climate change is already here.

In this week's reading as well as hearing Ken's personal stories of how he discusses his diet, I feel more competent when discussing climate change with others. I think I was always a little too pushy, shoving facts in everyone's faces but I've come to realize that isn't the way to make people listen. If climate scientists struggle with this problem as well, then I don't feel terrible about it, but now that I know how to open up a conversation rather than turn people off from what I'm saying, I think I can talk to more people about the topic. I do know some "Uncle Pete's" and it can be quite frustrating when they begin to spew "facts" out that aren't at all factual. I do feel bad for them because like chapter 8 discussed, they don't know that by disagreeing with the science they are hurting themselves. I personally liked how in the chapter, the author discussed how in the future when climate change takes over, the Uncle Pete's of the world will suffer from exactly what they didn't want happening right now such as limited freedom and more taxes. It's also quite ironic that the medicine field is so well respected and trusted but yet climate scientists are mocked daily. The metaphor the author used of if the earth had a fever like humans had fevers, we would all be doing something immediately to fix the problem. I just wish climate scientists were more respected because their field of work is arguably the most important as of this moment because of the severity of the climate change issue. We need help them by discussing climate change with anyone and everyone and getting the message out there, that we need to act fast and effectively if we want to have a healthy earth.

I too have worried about being pushy when it came to my diet choices. Somehow, it always felt like my choice to eat green was negatively affecting those I ate with. I felt like family members were critical of the fact that I wouldn't eat turkey at Thanksgiving, or that I made a vegetarian stuffing as if I was personally offending them. The stereotype of the pushy vegan is not the truth I've experienced. I've experienced the pushy meat eater. Often times, meat-eaters don't even know the food they're promoting or trying to have me eat is pushy, because it is the norm, or it is cultural. I've had friends where the tradition upon joining a club was to go to Chick-Fil-A. Now, I'm already against Chick-Fil-A because it's a very homophobic company, but it also isn't that vegetarian-friendly. 
                            <br><br>
I don't feel sorry for the Uncle Petes if I'm being honest. They ignore facts because they worship a far-right ideology and are determined to make the world worse for themselves, their families, and everyone else while they're at it. 
                            <br><br>
Also, if we're being honest, the medical field is also ignored. Think of the anti-vax movement. People are ignoring science because it doesn't line up with their agendas. And they're hurting people when they do this. 
                            <br><br>
We do need to get this message out there, but we need to be careful about it. Any amount of pushiness will be thrown right back in our face. Let's spread it through compassion and hard work, not yelling stats at people who have already decided not to listen.

Hi Alyssa thank you for sharing and I was totally in the same boat with you when it comes to persuading and educating others on the dangers and harmful effects of climate change. I would always get a little bit agitated or even irritated with people such as the "Uncle Petes" who are just so stubborn and just would not allow themselves to truly open their minds and see the truth behind the issue of climate change and who just refuse to be realistic by holding on so tight onto the scientific falsehoods and lies on climate change fabricated with a political or partisan motive. I used to never be able to understand the reason behind the stubbornness of those Uncle Petes and how they could blatantly reject scientific-proven facts and theories when they are laying out plainly right underneath their eyes. However, after doing the reading for this week, I began to understand bit by bit on the rationale of the climate change deniers and Uncle Petes' argument opposing climate change. I saw that they were worried about the extensive control and involvement of the government rather than the deteriorating climate change, and I was able to see where they were coming from with their so-called facts now that I understood their perspective.  
                            <br><br>
I was also surprised by the contrast in public sentiments towards the medical field and climate science field because I could not believe that our society would weigh people's personal health over the health of the environment since if the environment is gone and disappears us humans would be gone with it as well. 
                            <br><br>
All in all, it is a long process to help everyone particularly the stubborn Uncle Petes to see the true urgency of climate change and we still have a long way to go, but I am fairly optimistic that we will get there in the near future as long as we try to understand the perspective of the climate change deniers and use simple, effective, clear easy-to-understand communication methods such as through the usage of metaphors to communicate to those people and help them realize the true harmful impacts of climate change if no actions are taken.

Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions published by UC is a book filled with knowledge and reasonable solutions about the climate change issue. The chapter 8, communicating climate change issue introduces the importance of communicating issue to the audiences. I cannot agree more with the author that experts need to use the idea and words as simple as possible when they want to communicate the environmental issue. Because most people are just ordinary people, they do not want to read long and tedious paper to get the idea how important and emergency the climate change is. That is the reason why it is a cultural and psychological issue. 
                            <br><br>


What’s more, the climate change issue is more a moral issue for most people. If you do not support the green policy, no one will blame on you. However, it is a sense of social responsibility for our generation to save the planet. At minimum, we should give our future generation a sustainable planet to live. Recently, I have read a news that there are more wild animals appears and the air pollution index decreases from 200 to 40 in China because people stay at home to avoid the coronavirus. From this situation, I was really shocked how human beings control the whole planet in a long time and squeeze the living space of other species. Humans should apologize to the planet and take the action. We should take the responsibility because we play the leading role in the whole planet, just like Green New Deal ask the US to be the lead to solve climate change issue because US accounts for most greenhouse gas emission. To sum up, the chapter we read in Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions is enlightening and valuable. I also want to recommend my friends to read this book to know more about climate change.

After reading this chapter "Communicating the Climate Change Science" I found it intriguing to learn that one of the greatest barriers in communicating the climate crisis to regular people, and "Uncle Petes" is the scientific jargon and set up of the explanation. Being a stem major, I basically trained myself to read scientific articles and how to write and understand them in that format, I never thought that to regular people this would come off as boring and that all the facts stated would seem dry and insignificant. In addition, although it may seem obvious I never thought about how scientist's tones come off as dry and monotone because people are looking for passion, why not just trust the scientist? They are obviously passionate about it as they are researching the topic. 
                            <br><br>
Another thing that stood out to me was the comparison of climate science to medical science, and climate scientists to physicians. Why is it that people trust their doctors but not climate scientists. I believe this is driven by the idea that the climate does not directly affect them like their health, and they feel disconnected, automatically marking the topic as less important. However, with these communication tools listed in the chapter, we can communicate that the climate does, in fact, affect the people directly. The health of the earth affects everyone and this idea needs to become embedded into everyone's mind. 
                            <br><br>
Lastly, touching upon Ken's video regarding how to bring up into conversation that one is a vegan or vegetarian caught my attention. This is because at one point in time when I was at dinner with a few friends, one stated that she was now vegetarian, and in my head, I immediately judged. Not understanding why she was doing this I just thought she was being extra. Then she explained it was for environmental reasons but I still was not absorbing this. I realize now why she made the switch but also realize different and more effective ways to tell people that you are eating in regards to the climate, by using the term climatarian.

I also found it intriguing that "Communicating the Climate Change Science" claimed that jargon and science-based explanations is the biggest barrier when trying to convey the scope and scale of the climate crisis. Because of the volatile and violent nature of the modern political climate, and the rampant misuse of information and fear mongering by the media, I often find detailed descriptions of research to be refreshing. Taking the time to read and understand what is being explained is important to creating a healthy understanding of the world around us, as evident in by our assignment to read "The Green New Deal". But this claim undeniably holds water. Explaining concepts, especially those closely related to science, requires knowing the knowledge base of your audience. You can not explain gravity to a 5 year-old in the same way you could to a grad-student studying physics. In this case, treating your "Uncle Pete" as someone with little knowledge (without being condescending), and avoiding jargon and convoluted explanations, would be the best way to build a foundation and spread awareness.
                            <br><br>

However, I think it's dangerous to "just trust the scientist". As we've seen, it isn't exactly uncommon for scientists and researchers to accept bribes in return for publishing research that fits a certain narrative. The same can go for Doctors, and any other type of person that can capitalize off of their influence.
                            <br><br>

I had a similar experience with a close friend of mine, who chose to go vegetarian at some point in high school. "Extra" is the exact term that comes to mind when thinking about my opinions of my friend's choice, and I don't think that rebranding vegetarians as climatarians will do much to change that stigma. I do think, however, that it could do a lot for spreading the word of the environmental impact our agricultural system.

Coming into this week’s reading, I was honestly expecting to not understand a thing. Often times when I read books or publications, written by actual scientist, I find that they are filled with incomprehensible scientific jargon. They lose me within the first couple of pages. That is why I was surprised when I actually understood and was invested in the reading. Climate change communication is extremely important. Not only to those learning about the issue, but also to those who are informing others. This ties into the point about using the right jargon and knowing your audience. It is important that communicators understand the facts and the data they are communicating to others. That way, they are not just blindly repeating facts to others. As acknowledged in the book, it is important that communicators aren’t sharing misinformation. Climate change is a very touchy subject nowadays. Unfortunately, if false information is given, skeptics are quick to label all the facts as being ‘fake.’ One of the points that the climate expert brought up was that climate scientists are not seen with as much respect as medical scientists. I agree with this completely. I know of many adults who will see a false medical publication on facebook and be quick to share it to their friends and believe it. My sister and I always have to remind my mom that not everything she sees on facebook is the truth. On the contrary, the same people could see a post about climate change with logical evidence, and call it ‘fake news.’ I cant imagine what it must feel like to be a climate scientists and have all the evidence right in front of you, but nobody seems to listen or care. There were many quotes that resonated with me but the one that stuck with me the most was where it said, “We have found the enemy. He is us.” The U.S. spends a HUGE amount of money into just national security. We try and protect ourselves from outside threats, but in reality, we are our biggest threat. If we continue to contribute to climate change like we are now, no army, amount of money, or technology will be able to save us from the consequence of climate change.

I agree with you that I usually get confused reading publications by scientists on the basis of the climate crisis. This one, however, I was able to thoroughly understand. The reading this week explained how to communicate the climate crisis to people who don’t understand scientific jargon and to non-believers as well. It is crazy that a lot of people still don’t believe in the climate crisis with so much evidence. What we can do about this is to rebuttal anything that they might think wrong about the situation at hand. It is important that we know how to communicate with everyone about the climate crisis.
	                            <br><br>
Another important thing is being able to incorporate that it won’t be the end of the world when we communicate facts about the climate crisis. Scientists and informers have to use solutions to make people feel better about what we can do to solve this huge problem. One thing I took from the reading and the video is that I can’t just go around talking people’s ears off about the climate crisis. I have to let them ask me questions and let them take the initiative. Otherwise, they won’t really listen to me if I bring it up all the time, just as Ken stated about his experiences going out to eat with friends. I want to be able to spread this information to my family and friends without overwhelming them. This week’s readings really influenced me to watch how I communicate to people about the climate crisis.

<br><hr>

Briza, I completely agree with you as well. We've been inundated with statistics and convoluted paragraphs with much of the assigned readings. However, this week's reading has been especially more enjoyable to read because it is much more optimistic and does not only highlight the seemingly irreversible damage we have done to our planet—all while keeping the reading nice and simple. What I find most interesting about this book is that it breaks down and actually explains the most effective ways in which to defeat the climate crisis through the use of communication. Never have I actually given it much thought that symbolic language and the general way in which one speaks could make a significant difference in the way others perceive the things we say. Although these strategies are not usually expected to be used in everyday conversations, it is nice that the book gives examples in which they could be used in real life situations, even when the people on the other end are completely against your views. This information is very useful because I am one to usually stay quiet when debating current events because I am 1) uncertain as to how to present specific evidence in any given context 2) unsure how to maintain control of an argument when things are getting heated. 
	                            <br><br>
It is also interesting that the author states that "confronting climate change" is more so a "moral and ethical issue" rather than just a scientific topic. Just like Ken has mentioned in his previous lectures, it is our duty to clean up the mess that previous generations have left upon us. We owe our future generations a healthy planet in which they can enjoy oceans that are not heavily polluted and breather in fresh air instead of smog.

I also agree with how publications and books tend to limit their reach because of how much jargon fills up the works. Scientific jargon is really only understood by members of academia, and this ends up excluding a vast majority of people who could otherwise be motivated to make positive change for the environment. Like Briza, I was a bit surprised at how easy the chapter was digested. I also like how they included sections on stories and metaphors because I believe that being able to weave information into stories as well as memorable metaphors makes for the message to be better understood. Studying advertising has given me the idea of tailoring your message to fit the market as well as the medium, or the platform you’re speaking on. In this case, like Briza said, a lot of misinformation gets spread on Facebook because of how the medium has become somewhat of a news outlet for its users. I feel like climate scientists have the right to be frustrated when they have evidence of how much of an issue is at hand but they can’t forget that communication with their target audience depends heavily on being understood in the first place.

This week’s reading was one that I believe is very important in today’s society regarding the climate crisis. It is a topic that is often forgotten as those who are on opposing sides of this issue are commonly unwilling to change because of the lack of communication. This also goes for those who are unaware about this issue. This reading expresses the importance of communication amongst each other regardless of how much or how little information we know about this issue. The author did a good job making this chapter simple, yet informative about a vital stepping stone to turning our planets negative patterns around. The use of metaphors and easy to understand language allowed for this read to be quite enjoyable. It highlighted on a point that I believe to be one of the most important keys to a successful outcome in any conflicted situation. Communicating in a proper form is the only way that we will be able to get through to climate change deniers, or at least open them up to it a little bit. I really appreciated the metaphor used by the author regarding the earth having a fever. Just as humans would begin to take quite extreme actions against their own body temperature rising why are we not doing the same about our planet? It is a major issue that must be addressed soon, but must begin with appropriate communication to deniers. Something I did not enjoy as much as the fever metaphor was the example of Uncle Pete. While I understand where the author was intending to go with this example, it is the exact problem with our current state of communication. The author addresses this Uncle Pete, who I believe is just an average man who denies climate change,  in a condescending manner painting him as unintelligent. By having this mindset it is quite clear to me why there are so many Uncle Pete’s because it is unappealing to change opinions while one is not communicating with proper respect. Personally, I myself know a few “Uncle Pete’s” but by no means are they obnoxious or inadequate to understanding information. It is much more effective to follow what the author says about communication, but by not viewing the denier as less than you. 

	                            <br><br>

Overall I believe this reading was one of the most interactive and simple readings we have had so far. Not only was it informative, but it was essential to achieving the goals that must be met to save our planet. Although this chapter could have been edited to be more accurate in its depiction of deniers it was one that many people need to read. Communication is a fundamental key to resolving all conflicts especially in regards to climate change. Shouting facts and putting them in the face of the opposing view will get us nowhere. This chapter is one that many of us should take to heart.

I do agree that the message in which climate change is being placed across is extremely important. I also like that Ken has described himself as a “climatarian” rather than placing a label on himself as a vegetarian, vegan, or freegan. It is extremely important that we do not stigmatize these different labels, which has placed great danger to the climate change movement because it offers a stereotype that not everyone fits. Instead, the idea of climate change, or being a “climatarian” is to try; just putting the effort in. I think that we must always make sure that we are putting our best foot forward in order to make sure that we are doing the best we can to help solve the climate crisis. However, by putting labels on ourselves instead of just putting the effort in, we are placing ourselves in the “other’ category when we are talking to the masses. We are making our message less effective by being seen as less credible or unrelatable since we are not “one of them” or “regular.” So, when Ken talks about labels, I do believe that it is the right thing to do and just put in the effort. 
	                            <br><br>


As Ken also said, I think that when we place our message across, I do not believe that we should just shove our opinions down someone else’s throats, whether they may already agree or strongly disagree. No one likes to have that done to them, so everyone should consider the same courtesy when we are talking about others in the same regard. I think that we have to be patient and wait for them to admire what we do and have the courage to wait for them to seek us out and ask. I do not think that forcing someone to live a lifestyle that you live and saying that it is amazing will do anything because they will always take that advice with a grain of salt. 

	                            <br><br>

However, what I find that is extremely ineffective when people are trying to spread their message about climate change to the rest of the world is when we bring other ideas down. I think that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, whether we agree with it or not. However, putting other people down and spitting on someone else’s ideas is not the way to go about and make great change. We say that we need unity in order to create a revolution, but how do we reflect that if all we are doing is just bringing the other side down in order to lift ourselves up? I think that we need to rethink the way that we strategize climate change and instead of bashing other people about their own opinions, we must do a better job of understand, but respectfully disagreeing.

One of the comments I love and work to live by that Ken mentioned is: "If you want to change the world, start with yourself." I try to exemplify this in my life as much as possible. I have realized that not everyone will want to live that I do: they like eating meat, they love shopping and travel all over the globe. This used to frustrate me to no end. When I first started my low-impact journey, I would get mad at people for not wanting to change almost to the point of becoming a militant climate activist that is critical of everyone. However, over time I have realized that the only person I will ever have full influence over is myself, and I can do a lot as one person. Since this epiphany, I have changed my approach to displaying my lifestyle by acting and not talking. This is a point that Ken mentioned in his lecture as well. Occasionally when I'm cooking something at home, or come back from the thrift store, I will show off the goods I have. This often will drive a conversation with others about either the cost of the good, why I chose that lifestyle or how I can live this way long-term. 
	                            <br><br>
Through these small interactions and often leading by example, I have been able to create open conversations about the way people live their lives currently and ways to make positive climate change. This can be helping a housemate sort the recycling correctly, have my mom taste a vegan dish I made, or just not feeling shame when I binge watch sustainable influencers on Youtube for hours in my living room. 
	                            <br><br>
I posted about this in an earlier post, but the best approach to make the change is through kindness, tolerance, and loving nudges. People are often turned off to negative critiques, which makes them less open to the idea in the long run. When talking to others, just try to be kind and understanding because we all could use it.

Madison, this realization is very wise of you. Being slightly farther behind you in my low-impact journey, I would sometimes get annoyed or offended if someone shamed me for occasionally eating meat or not using sustainable items. I feel like those who demonstrate their sustainable lifestyles are far more successful in getting others to act as compared to those who preach their lifestyles. Seeing my vegan or sustainable friends who are not overbearing in their beliefs are people who I respect the most, and I aspire to carry out a similar lifestyle.


<br><hr>
Before we can preach the lifestyle that someone else should strictly follow, we must ask ourselves the steps it took for us to get where we want them to be. A person’s culture, background, circumstances, and personal beliefs should all be considered when asking them to make a major shift within their lives. Ken told us his journey of going from pescatarian to vegetarian to vegan, over the course of many years, illustrating how changing an aspect of your life can take time and effort. A motto I like to remind myself of is to not ask of others what I would not do myself. I think this means that it would be unfair and ridiculous to ask or order someone to do something that I wouldn’t even do myself, especially in terms of a team when we should be considered equals. In terms of the climate crisis, this can be equated to encouraging others to consider a more plant-based diet or drive less, when I wouldn’t even consider those things myself.

A better way to communicate environmental issues to people who may not be especially inclined to act sustainably is to first get a handle on what their belief and value systems are to be able to better cater to their needs. If I knew someone cared more about their personal freedom, money, or protecting certain aspects of our environment, I would provide evidence and facts to ensure them climate change directly affects their life. One way to do this is to approach them with respect and listen to their side with sincerity and mutuality. I think it is important to not get defensive, but also know how to address and deal with their defensiveness. In the end, it should be a clear and simple conversation between two civil adults to become more understanding of each other.

I really like your outlook. I agree with Ken that if you want to change the world, you have to start with yourself. Unfortunately, I had this long standing mentality that it is not worth making the life change when my carbon footprint alone won’t make a difference. I know that this was a bad way of looking at it, but I found it incredibly discouraging to know that the majority of the world isn’t doing it and so I would often think what’s the point? Why should I make that change in my life when so many people would not be willing to do it in theirs? I really liked how you mentioned that the only person that you will ever have full influence over is yourself, and that you can do a lot as one person. This alone inspires me to make a bigger effort when I’m out shopping for food and clothes. I want to have a more sustainable lifestyle. I liked how Ken mentioned that being a freegan is not like being a vegan. You can make a freegan decision about what you want to eat or do throughout the day. Maybe one day you cheat it a little, but for the majority of the time, you manage to eat more sustainably for the environment. This is something that I aspire to do. Thank you for your response.

This weeks reading I found really interesting. You know the topic of veganism is always a touchy subject in my culture. Some people in my family would consider disrespectful or think that you can’t sustain a healthy lifestyle with it. So I think it’s clear that I have some “Uncle Petes” in my household. And I’m sure a good majority of this country is an uncle Pete to some certain extent. One of the things that always fascinated me with Veganism was not veganism itself by how other perceived people who were vegan. You there’s this image of a vegan that has permeated the minds of a majority of the population that portrayed vegans as these self righteous people who saw down upon anyone who didn’t conform to their lifestyles. And while I’m sure that type of Vegan is defiantly out there a lot of people who have this perception of vegans haven’t even met a vegan before. And it’s just crazy to me that someone could have that sort of mentality towards a group of people they don’t know much about. It makes sense though I feel as if it’s almost ingrained as typical human reaction. Let’s say you’re out for dinner with a vegan and they tell you that there vegan. I think many people would get defensive because you understand the reasoning that they have for going vegan and you start to get defensive because you know that your the problem and that your lifestyle isn’t ethical. And most people don’t want to think that they’re savages who are living an unsustainable lifestyle that killing an unthinkable amount of cute animals and the planet as well. As a result the vegan stereotype is applied as to justify your lifestyle. My older sister went vegan for a while and she was given this weird look about by everyone that she had to tell. It eventually became an insecurity for her and she stopped being vegan soon after. I think we need to educate people more on what a vegan is and how it’s beneficial more in our society. But also be more efficient at communicating veganism to other people. As ken points out maybe waiting for people to come to you first and advocating for climatarianism first.

This reading really honed on informing the public and the best way to do it. Despite all the denial, climate change is real and we as people need to fully understand that it is our duty to inform the people about the actual truth. Yet there are 5 important steps when it comes to informing people about the climate crisis. Preparation, stories, metaphors, language, and then finally include solutions. Prepare by being informed, in order to educate others you must be knowledgeable enough to be able to fully explain. You cannot inform someone with no information, so inform yourself first. Then incorporate stories, connect to the reader via emotions. In this case the author uses Uncle Pete but emotionally connecting to others is effective. Hearing about people losing their homes and babies dying draws attention more than stating facts at times. Metaphors are also important because they really draw attention on what needs to be made as well as connecting the audience to common topics. The author uses thermostat and baseball references that create a bigger audience connection. If you give a great ball player some steroids, and he plays better. The question is not whether or not the steroids caused his greatness but instead observing the difference between his stats with and without steroids. That is the Earth, Co2 rises and falls but the dramatic increase in the past 100 years makes us the steroids and consumerism is at the core. Next is jargon, we cannot confuse people with the way data is presented and scary words used in articles. We also need to hone on the importance of different data, the scientific community deals a lot of background information while the masses want supporting details, importance and the bottom line. Lastly is the solutions, the climate crisis is devastating and depressing so we need to offer solutions instead of whining. Introduce ideas that improve your habits and yourself. This is how we create change- inform.

I think Chapter eight, “Communicating Climate Change Science” discusses an important topic that is not really mentioned. I agree with the statements it makes about how important the way important topics are communicated to an audience. Like mentioned most of the time people, especially skeptics, ask for evidence to back up a claim about the climate crisis and scientists then feel that they must explain all the data they have worked on. Yet the fact is most people don’t have the time, the patience, or are too confused to hear about every single detail presented and may not understand complex data. I do think to effectively communicate a message it must be short,concise, and accurate. It would be nice if the climate crisis was seen just as that a crisis that involves humanity as a whole regardless of politics or opinion. Yet realistically society is not there and so it's important that when we do address an audience to know what they value  and take that into mind for what is said. I agree many people think that implementing regulations and changing our society to become greenhouse gas emission free will limit us and cause lots of change. The fact that in order to stop the climate crisis from getting worse, freedom will be limited more and there will be a lot more regulation, but as mentioned so would a global scale of chaos that would be caused because of this crisis if we continue on this path. I think this chapter clearly explains the steps which help explain the topic more effectively to try to get the audience to digest the information and really take it into mind.

I completely agree!  I've found that when I read scientific texts containing information/data on the climate impacts human beings are having it is often filled with lots of scientific jargon and a ton of information which can be hard to sift through and take meaning out of.  I also think that the best way to educate most of the population is with simple and concise statements, that contain simple facts and information and aren't trying to sway or accuse you super hard or paint one side as being the "bad guy" and one side the "good guy" because that seems to shut down conversations as Ken was saying in his video.  I think that people are scared of change, and not knowing what would happen in the process of becoming greenhouse gas emission-free because people are comfortable with how they are living now, and don't want to be uncomfortable.  However, if we continue down the route we are currently taking, I think that eventually, we are going to have an even more radical change (once the climate crisis catches up to us), which would be far more negative and have a greater impact on the world than moving towards a more sustainable future.  I think we are already seeing a negative change, with the scale of natural disasters increasing and happening much more frequently than they did in past years, but it is happening slowly so I don't think it is alarming people as much as it should.  Overall, I also agree that the chapter did a good job clearly labeling the (possible) steps that need to be taken and explain the topic in a way that is easy to digest.

I agree with you. Communication is a very vital skill in socializing and interpersonal interactions. Humans are social animals. Our actions and speaking will affect other people. Language is a powerful weapon. It has the power to alter people’s mind and opinion. I totally agree with the passage that choosing the language we used is very critical in persuading people. Language is magical. If you use different style of tone and language to explain one single opinion or issue, people will have different feelings and attitude toward them. I agree with what Ken says. Directly implanting the idea of being a vegan or climate activist is not helpful and might cause opposite effect because people might think that you are forcing them to do something and controlling them. The better way to promote the idea of environment conservation is talking in more anecdotal ways or explain to people when they have the desire to know more about it. For someone who acts like Uncle Pete, you can’t just simply tell him that his idea is completely wrong. You can patiently show some concrete facts and examples to persuade him, even though this process might be long.

I believe that the reading, "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" is an important text about how we, as people educated about the climate crisis, should spread information. This reading helped me understand why it is important for people educated about the climate crisis, to spread accurate information in a way that is easily presented to the public. The chapter 8 reading included five steps in order to be successful in communicating climate change. The first step was preparation. In order to communicate information effectively, an individual must be educated about the topic and have answers to basic questions that skeptics of climate change usually ask. The reading then went into having a story or personal experience about how climate change has effected people or you. The text used an example of "Uncle Pete" to show its readers how they might come across conservative skeptics that do not trust anything about climate crisis. Using personal anecdotes and stories in your discussion about climate change enhances your argument because it appeals to your audience's emotions. The third step included how you should use metaphors when educating people about the climate crisis. An example I resonated with in the text was, "We have our hands on the thermostat that controls future climate". Using metaphors helps you audience understand why climate change is such a big deal. If you were just to use scientific jargon, the general public would not understand what you were talking about.  This goes into the fourth step of using the correct language. Generally, scientists use research methods to communicate their findings about climate change. However, as educators, we should discuss climate change in a more simplistic manner such as saying what the bottom line is, what we should do about climate change, and supporting details to back up your claims. Finally, we should always discuss the solutions of how we can lessen the repercussions of this ongoing climate crisis. If people aren't aware of solutions, they will never know what to do about climate change. People knowledgeable about climate change should speak optimistically about solutions such as discussing the perks of renewable energy and how solar and wind energy are becoming more accessible and cheaper.

I think it is very important to acknowledge everyone to know the importance about the climate crisis. Having a environment experts is   not as important as having 100 people care and work for the environment, because this is not something can solved by a few groups of elites with special treatments, it should be a problem that be solved by everyone works together. These five steps are actually very helpful and important for everyone to learn. It is true the scientists are good at research but they are not good at express their ideas. Due to the research paper have to be a formal tone, the way they express the ideas, the solutions and the importances are very hard to understand and hard to be memorized. Instead easier way of expressing ideas in a generally speaking way is more helpful. We as students and young generations can learn how to use these methods to express the ideas to older generations. We can use the daily examples, daily easy solutions and the easy-understandable significants to draw people's attentions and make more people care and work for this. That will be the only solutions for us to solve the problem is that everyone works to solve for this. We all eat turkey than beef is better than a few percentage of people eat vegetables only. If we have a large population, everyone only needs to do a little and the number combined will be large enough.

So often I do not feel like people prepare to have real meaningful conversations about climate change, or serious topics in general for that matter. With the sheer level of misinformation and “fake news” that is being circulated every day, it comes down to every individual who cares about these things to do their own research, make sure they have the facts straight, and then be able to communicate them effectively when it comes time. Knowledge really is power in this sense. I do think that appealing to your audience is a good method to communicate some of the time, but definitely not all of the time. When you start arguing about facts, things become objective. There are no subjective interpretations because things just are the way they are; there is data or statistics, or real hard evidence to prove it. Emotions often play into being subjective about something. I think that can really hinder someone’s message when communicating facts because if people disagree for some reason, they will have their own emotions because they don’t want to feel wrong. And arguing with emotions turns into a difficult task where both sides cannot truly understand and hear one another. When it comes to metaphors, I do agree that they can be useful in communicating important messages very quickly and clearly, but they should not be overused or the message becomes too simple, when in fact the reality is that climate change is a complex and massive issue stemming from a multitude of areas. This also becomes the problem with oversimplifying information. While I don’t think it is necessary to communicate everything in a scientific or professional manner, some things do need to be discussed in detail at some point. Make it too simple, then people won’t have an accurate picture of what is going on. Lastly, I do agree that we should always, now and forever with any problem -- personal or global -- discuss solutions. We all need to be thinking together on how to make change happen, and people need to know that there are ways to fix this, maybe they just haven’t thought about certain solutions yet or heard of them. We should all strive to educate those around us, listen to every perspective, think about things objectively and logically, and make change happen.

I really liked the point you made about awareness. If people aren’t aware of the problem, then how will they ever make a difference?? Also on a similar note, if people are fed the wrong info, then how can they make any good change or help the course grow? It is important to educate others about the climate and its changes and how this will and currently is affecting us and how we can make a change. I liked the article becuase I was able to get a better understanding about how I am suppose to educate. This class and the info we learn are great, but how can I apply to to teaching others. If I can’t share what I learned accurately, then this problem will never be close to being fixed.

I the part that impressed the most is chapter 8-3 Metaphor. At the beginning of the chapter,  the author, Richard Somerville, compare our actions to “thermostat that controls the future climate.” At the end of this chapter, the author shared a story that his friends dedicated his whole life to the career of studying climate change and finished the “Keeling Curve” that shows the increasing amount of CO2 that has been put into the atmosphere, and the author re-mentioned that we can change this curve since we hold the thermostat. Most scientists spend most of their lives and efforts just to remind us that we need to change some of our lifestyles or otherwise we will face big troubles, but whether you act or not, it’s up to the decision to you. There’s no reason to attack them or call their effort a hoax. No one will trick others or lie to others with their whole life without any benefit. Just like the metaphor made by the author, environmental scientists are the “Planetary Physicians.” They didn’t expect that you can make some major contributions to the issue. They just want you to know the urgency and importance. Knowing that we should make the right decision which is to act and change some, even just a little, our lifestyle that hurts our planet, which hurts our future.

Another thing that I like about the article is that Professor Ken mentioned, the communication with Uncle Pete. In the book, the author has already given many very specific answers to some questions that are frequently asked by Uncle Pete, which I thought is very useful. Sometimes, I just couldn’t get up with an answer that is compelling enough to tell my friends or families, and the conversation just went a bit out of control. With the suggestions of Ken and the author, I think, in the future, I can get a more proper and comfortable way to communicate or discuss with others about environmental problems.

While reading, there was a part in the beginning which described what science is. Science, in its purest form, is conclusions based on facts and evidence, while beliefs are only what the people believe in facts and evidence or not. Because of the fact that science is the foundation of the argument of climate crisis, it serves as an “extremely persuasive” method of convincing people. Even with all the evidence supporting climate change, Uncle Pete will always be there to refute it and butt in, the root of this being people who don’t want to be controlled. This serves as a reminder that Uncle Pete is too radical and that the only thing fueling this is the power of human greed. While I was reading the chapter, I liked how it was structured so that it was an easy step lesson to convince people about our climate crisis. This structure enables the reader to stay engaged and see that it isn’t hard to convince people and we should in order to help save the earth. Without the participation of the people, there will be no change and there will be nothing we can do. Because of the facts and evidence shown, it is easy to see that the support behind the prevention of the climate crisis and that we should do something in order to stop the earth from deteriorating beyond repair. Reading the entirety of it showed me that we must do everything that we can in order to communicate to everybody else that we do indeed have a problem and we need to stop it, but of course there will always be people who don’t agree with us. We need to be able to present the facts that we have and use science as our weapons in order for us to get straight to the root of the problem and allow ourselves to live in a better world.

The chapter on communicating the issue of climate change to the public from “Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions” for this week was a very interesting and educational reading material because it illustrated some of the major problems in the climate scientists’ ways of educating the public on the climate crisis and ways to solve those communication issues in order to raise the public awareness on the urgency and pressing nature of climate change. One quote from the reading stood out to me at the beginning, “the more you say, the less they hear.” I realized that this was indeed a very honest and truthful statement because many times the patience of the public wears thin whenever climate scientists discuss the issue of climate change and the ways we as humans can do to mitigate this crisis in an extremely professional and scientific manner. A major reason behind this reaction from the public is the large number of scientific jargons and specific terms used by the climate scientists that are way too deep and academic for the public that many people find it very difficult to truly understand the climate scientists’ talks with the barriers of those scientific jargons. Consequently, short sweet simple language such as that of this book is much more ideal for educating the public on climate change because it is written in simple plain English suitable for people with all levels of education in society. 
	                            <br><br>


The section on incorporating metaphors in informing the public on climate change is also a new yet fascinating concept to me because I have never encountered the usage of metaphors in the talks of climate scientists when they describe the issue of climate change other than in this book. Using vivid easy-to-understand metaphors is another way of effectively relaying the scientific information regarding climate change to the public. Metaphors are more relatable to the audience and by converting the harmful negative consequences of climate change into simple vivid relatable metaphor examples derived from people’s everyday lives, the information is far more accepting and welcoming to the public since they can understand it from a normal everyday perspective, which in turn makes the process of understanding the causes and impacts of climate change much easier and smoother for the public.

Lastly, with the example Ken gave in the lecture video on the reading, it is even more obvious to see the different results and impacts of various methods of communication hence the crucial role of communication in our modern society. To be perfectly honest, when I hear people say that they are vegan, the first thing that came to my mind was that those people were probably under some kinds of restrictions due to their religious or cultural beliefs and they were likely to hold a higher moral standard with their decision not to eat any meat. Moreover, if I were to grab food with them the situation would be very awkward and embarrassing for both parties because of our different diet preferences. Although people who are vegan do not necessarily think this way, the truth is that people like me who are not vegan will more or less hold some stereotypical conceptions towards vegan dieters in terms of their religious or cultural influences and moral standards, and just like what Ken described in the video, those conceptions tend to be more negative rather than positive. However, if people who are vegan say that they are climatarian and are eating a largely plant-based diet consciously with the climate and the environment in mind, the situation will be much better as others will be interested or curious of a climatarian’s diet and they are more likely to become climatarians with this spark of intrigue and eventually vegans in the future. 

	                            <br><br>

The reading and the examples Ken gave in the video really showed the critical role of communication in our modern world especially when it comes to climate change. As a result of the campaign of disinformation and misleading fabricated lies on the truth of climate change, there are many “Uncle Petes” in the American public who deny and refuse to recognize the legitimacy of climate change. In order to truly change the minds and the stubborn mindsets of the “Uncle Petes” in relation to climate change, simple, clear, effective communication is key and we should utilize it well to allow the climate change deniers to see the real detrimental consequences of climate change on the entire planet and all of its lives.

This week’s reading, Communicating Climate Change Science, was a thoughtful, easy-to-read overview of the science of climate change, as well as why it is such a controversial political issue and how to go about communicating about the crisis. When I registered for this class, my motivation was to learn more about climate change and how to help mitigate the crisis, but also to learn how to approach/respond to deniers and skeptics. Everything we have learned about in this class so far has been so incredibly useful to me in learning the environmental impacts behind simple actions, but I still felt uneasy about whether this knowledge would make any sort of an impact. This reading was exactly what I was looking for, a very basic and accessible introduction to the issue and clear advice for dealing with the “Uncle Petes” in my life. Like Ken rightly notes, there are a lot of young people who believe in climate change, but I think until you have it explained to you in simple understandable language you aren’t going to truly process the reality of it. I think the author’s recommendations of using metaphors was particularly significant -- since I will always remember the analogy that Ken used about 1 in 8 people smoking cigarettes being enough for every person on the planet after to suffer fatal consequences. Using metaphors, simple language, and stories are all useful techniques for presenting facts about climate change, but I think if your goal is to change people’s behavior, then Ken’s advice is the most efficient. People are very stubborn, they don’t like being told what they “should” do. I think this is a huge reason why vegans have such a negative reputation, not because their lifestyles are wrong but because people don’t like feeling guilty or judged, especially at the dinner table. If instead of trying to convince everyone to become vegan, we focus on changing our own habits, then people will start to notice, and hopefully want to learn more as well.

I can totally understand what you are saying here. It is true that understanding climate changes is not only about the fact of it, but also about how the information and knowledge of this issue are being understood by the people. There are always people who have different opinions and points of views, the way one understands an issue and how much they are willing to accept a fact or to deny a fact strongly based on how they are being told/taught. Thus, this reading is such a useful one in helping us understand the importance in good communication. And you are totally right, using a more simple and easy to understand language is more easily accepted and understood by people. Also, using metaphors or something that relates to people’s experience/stories also help them to learn the facts.

	                            <br><br>

Climate change is always an issue hard to be addressed and solved, it is more important to get people to learn the facts of it and leave them space to decide themselves on how to think about the issue. In order to get people to take part in actions to help addressing climate crisis, we should get them to learn something they are interested in and more likely to accept and to do. I personally think it is not about getting and forcing people to be convinced with what we say, but to make them willing to understand our points of view and stand on our sides. So, how we are spreading the message and talk about the issue to the public needs the key in having good communication.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with you about the stigmatism that surrounds people who are trying to make a difference simply because people do not like feeling guilty. I come from an area where climate change isn't talked about and where vegans and vegetarians are shamed for being the minority, but coming to UCSB it's so refreshing to see a large group of students take initiative and want to do better for the plant and people have asked questions. I have had conversations with people where I attempt to use the metaphor tactic to put into perspective the damage that's happening and they have simply said they are not interested in hearing it because they are comfortable with their way of life. I think an Uncle Pete character is so relatable because we all know and love someone who has no business expressing their uneducated opinion about the climate crisis and has no interest in knowing anything about it. I appreciate Ken exposing us to the political issues regarding the climate crisis but I can't help but feel like sometimes it's a lost cause considering that the majority of college campuses are aware of a lot of these issues and are politically on the same side anyway. If we want change to happen we need a more effective way to influence people outside our political party. It's always easy to express our opinions to people who are like-minded and to those who are already on our side, but outside the university,  this may not always be the case and this is where we are falling short with how we are handling the climate crisis.

One important takeaway from this chapter is to say less in order for people to remember what you say. This is so important in any form of education, people get board when someone drones on, lit goes in one ear and out the other. Another very important thing is to know your material inside and out. Especially if it is something that is controversial in some circles, like climate change. Being prepared to answer questions is crucial. The emotional pull is another important factor People like Stories because they can relate to them much more than facts.

I appreciate how clearly this chapter lays everything out. It states many things that I already know,  but in a very organized manner. The way information is portrayed is so important because even if the information is the best information, it doesn’t matter if the audience cannot digest it.

“Climate change is much more than a scientific topic”. This stood out to me when reading the article because even though it is a short sentence, it is powerful. Many people believe that climate change is scientific and is full of numbers, calculations, and predictions, but it is much more than that. Climate change affects people on a day to day basis and is actually less about numbers and more about what we can do on a day to day basis. Us, as inhabitants on this Earth, owe it to each other and to the Earth to stand up and do something about the destruction that has been done. I think this paper does a good job at setting this up as it starts with Preparation in order to educate people on the ins and outs of climate change and then leads to stories, metaphors, language, and solution. By including these in this order (and by including all of these together) the four sections work in conjunction with each other in order to spread awareness, personal stories, and real solutions to the climate crisis. It is very important to be able to recognize who our audiences are in order to actually permeate their preconceived ideas of the climate crisis and inform them on what has happened and the things that need to be done. Personally, I am from Texas and much of my Dad’s side of the family doesn’t believe in climate change for whatever reason they think best suits them for that day. Having these points in my back pocket to go against what they say is very important to me as I am able to actually shut down their claims.

I totally agree, and I think that sentence highlights one of the most important messages from this class. We need to look at both a scientific and humanities approach to solving the climate crisis. So much of the work that has to be done involves a pretty massive cultural shift in society. That cannot be mitigated by science. Science can tell us what we need to do, but the humanities will tell us how we are going to get people to act.


<br><hr>
Agreed, I think that people fail to realize that their actions will have consequences and just resort to saying that "It's cold today, where's global warming" and just brush it off. Using the right language talking to climate change deniers can have a beneficial impact on getting them to realize the reality of the situation and the consequences that people face right now because of our actions. That being said, if we attack them for being uneducated, that will only further their own beliefs and make them less likely to want to engage in conversation with you. Bringing things to a personal level rather than a scientific and talking about numbers can help other people wrap their heads around what climate change is and how we can fight it to create a better world for everyone to live in.

Indeed, we’ve all met uncle Pete in our life. But from my perspective, people like uncle Pete don't believe in, or don't want to believe the climate crisis because it contradicts their personal interest. Communicating to them the idea of global warming is just like trying to convince a Buddhist that Jesus is real. Similarly, you can’t expect those who have a high opinion of the free market to support minimalism and reduced meat consumption and everything.

Therefore, Ken’s idea in communicating with people that are not as skeptic is maybe a more feasible solution and the action that I might probably take. It is important that you don’t start the topic and try to convince people into changing their habit thoroughly out of nowhere. That sounds like convincing people into this action is related to your personal interests, which raise resistance immediately. Even a smart salesman would not do that. 
	                            <br><br>

However, just like the car with a broken window is more likely to be treated carelessly, people need a small excuse to start a long term, consistent habit. Baby steps first. Once they started to consider themselves as people who think about their impact on climate when eating, they might start up on doing others like bike more and support the Green New deal.
	                            <br><br>

 It is always more effective to convince people into something by trying to include them by letting them feel that they are already part of the group than excluding them by advocating extreme behaviors that are far from their current habits.

I completely agree with what you said about everyone having met an “Uncle Pete” in their life. Personally, I have a friend who does not believe in the climate crisis or anything relating to climate change. It is hard for me to fathom how she came to develop these beliefs as we both grew up in a pretty liberal area. Even from a young age, we were taught in school that climate change is in fact, very real and that humans are at the center of it all. She even took AP Environmental Science with me in high school! To this day, I never understood why she would take that class despite her denial of climate change. Sadly, the course still did not change her opinion on climate change at all. Majority of what she says in regards to climate change is typical of what every other skeptic or  climate change denier would say: it’s not real, the planet is not warming, it’s natural, there’s no way that humans can alter the planet, blah blah blah. In her opinion, the climate crisis is not that big of a deal and scientists are exaggerating the facts in an attempt to scare us. Over time, I have learned to respect her opinions, even if I do not agree with them. Eventually, I stopped talking to her about anything that had to do with climate change in any way, shape, or form. At the end of the day, it’s like talking to a brick wall since she does not want to listen to anything I have to say. There is no point in trying to convince someone who is unwilling to see anything else but what they believe to be true.

I really enjoyed reading "Bending the Curve" because it was easy read and was very informative and relatable. The idea of an "Uncle Pete" and how so many people have someone in their life that resemble the character show how many people are still so skeptic of climate change. I don't think my family has ever discussed climate change and when I was asked about school, which IS a common topic at the dinner table, I talked about English 23 and what I've been learning. I had no idea what my family's stance on climate change was but I was very surprised to hear that a majority of my family were open to listening about it. Sure I did have to assert the things I've learned, but it was nice to see that my family was receptive to the information. But being receptive to the information did not mean making change which was hard for me to grasp. My sister became a vegetarian nearly a year ago and my family took it horribly. Despite it not affecting their personal diets, they constantly tried to make my sister eat meat again because "the body needs meat". Luckily, my sister did not give in and now my family doesn't bother. But it made me realize that my family would most likely never become vegetarians or even close. Which was a sad realization, but I do believe that I can start to limit the amount of meat they consume or making choices like chicken over beef. Communication truly is key to making others feel heard and not attacked while still asserting your point and the reading was a great resource.

I agree that this reading was relatable, especially due to the metaphor of Uncle Pete. My sister has been vegetarian for many years and my family is not particularly supportive of it. My brothers even give her crap for not eating meat and my mom does not always cater to a meat free diet. This is not really because my family does not believe in climate change or support sustainability, but rather that they just do not really understand all the consequences of their lifestyles. 
	                            <br><br>

Furthermore, I thought the reading noted something important when talking about the difference between climate and weather. Sure, maybe weather is not always extremely predictable as we can see in the frequent incorrectness of weather forecasts; however, climate is based on statistics and patterns that actually are very reliable and predictable. 
	                            <br><br>

The reading also highlights how much research has gone into proving the climate crisis. Charles David Keeling spent decades creating the Keeling Curve, which is the famous graph showing CO2 levels. Despite all this research, the media finds ways to convince the public that it is not reliable or hides the important information by "burying the lead".
	                            <br><br>

The reading continues to emphasize that there are reasons to be optimistic and that it is very important to do so because making people lose hope is only going to make the situation worse.

“Before changing the world you must change yourself.” This quote accurately sums up the debate on which is the best way to combat climate change. And I completely agree: the first steps in reaching a more sustainable, livable earth begin with ourselves. Movements begin with many individual actions, which is why being able to communicate these ideals and methods is absolutely vital to getting the climate crisis in the global spotlight. Chapter 8 of Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions arms its audience with effective strategies, showing us how to preach what we practice. The key points the author brings us are concise and powerful: repetitive simplicity delivered by reputable, dependable voices. I love how the chapter explores different aspects of communicating the truths of the climate crisis, from knowing one’s audience (connecting broader aspects of climate change to everyday experiences that the people around us would recognize) to utilizing metaphors (planetary physicians was my favorite), to carefully chosen diction (scientific connotation of words vs everyday meaning) and a follow through of solutions. Personally, I found the tone of the authors to be rather annoying, sounding much like the high school popular girl who thinks she’s better than everyone because she’s ‘woke.’ I mean “most people have never met a scientist” is such a dramatic line. Besides that, the points made were solid. And Ken’s addition to the Uncle Pete metaphor really broadened the lesson taught here, teaching the audience not only how to approach climate change deniers, but also to our open-minded friends; how to approach a real opportunity to create change.

I loved your comment because I thought I was the only one who had believed that while the author made very good explanations about how people should address the climate change crisis issue, he almost sounded haughty and believed scientists to be above others which I didn’t very much agree with. It was those moments where he continuously mentioned how most people have never met a scientist because yes they are sooooo rare and special that almost made me want to stop reading. However, what saved me was the genuine honesty that rang in his words when he wrote about how urgent it is to start working and addressing climate change. It was clear to me that this author is someone who cares deeply for the planet and most importantly for those innocents who will be left with the remains we leave behind. If he didn’t care, then why would he dedicate a whole 36 pages of a chapter to teach others how to themselves communicate with friends and family how important the issue is. The quote that stuck with me the most was when he sadly pointed out that “Despite the strong scientific consensus, climate change policy is contentious politically.” This struck deeply for me for many reasons. It is such a statement that feels so wrong to anyone reading it because there is so much wrong about it but yet unfortunately true. The climate crisis has been supported time and time again with hard scientific research and facts because normally that’s what people need to hear and what they’ll believe. Yet, in this case even this is not getting through to people, mainly politicians...what should be an issue based on facts and even ethics now that the lives of future generations are at risk has been reduced to a topic meant to be “won” at primaries. When will people see that this is not a matter of which candidate supports and which doesn’t, it is and especially now, is a matter of life and death for our future populations.

I agree with your statement that the quote “Before changing the world you must change yourself” as being an important quote for the debate of tackling climate change. Often times, the people who do not believe that the United States could switch to renewable energy sources or eating less beef are the same people who are not willing to make those switches themselves. I will admit, I myself am someone who is weary of the transition from where we are structurally right now and where we need to be because it is a great change. However, I am one for this change even if it will be a rough transition period. I believe that this chapter was very helpful because I never realized just how important communicating the problem of climate change was before reading this. I always just assumed that the deniers of climate change thought that it was a hoax and for changing our government since we are all liberals or socialists. Now I understand that just how we state the information about climate change and who is saying it has a huge impact on the audience members. As you stated, “repetitive simplicity delivered by reputable, dependable voices” are the key points of this chapter and how we are going to get people change themselves so that we can change the world. What I found most interesting about the reading was the part about metaphors and how connecting it to things the audience can understand helps them get a better grasp on the topic. For example, the metaphor “we have our hands on he thermostat that will control the climate of our children and grandchildren” can be helpful because it shows that the choices that we make in our daily lives and the societal structure we live in affects the next generation. In addition, if the audience were to hear these metaphors from a popular celebrity rather than a teacher or a scientist they are more likely to listen fully and grasp more information. So if we were to get more people in higher statuses in our country to talk about climate change in a way that is relatable to the audience members, we will finally be able to make the change that we need.

Yes exactly! Global change simply must begin on an individual level, and this chapter really highlights a lot of great strategies. I really love your analysis of metaphors and the public's perception of the climate crisis.

I'm glad that you picked up on the subtle attitude of the author's writing style. His pretentious presentation almost made me dislike the content, but, like you said, you can tell just how passionate he is about this topic. I love your use of the quote “Despite the strong scientific consensus, climate change policy is contentious politically.” It's a great addition to the points you made about the relationship between politics and the climate crisis.

In the book ‘Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions”, the author divides chapter 8 into five parts, preparation, stories, metaphors, languages, and solutions. Preparation is to prepare well to convey the idea of climate change science. As communicators, they need to have adequate knowledge to answer the questions about climate change, and they also need to know the principle to communicate with others. The author also takes the doctor as an example to illustrate the importance of using clear and simple terms. He also mentions that it is necessary to repeat the terms. In addition, a trusted messager is the key to make people accept climate change science. He makes his message more powerful and persuasive by listing simple and clear facts: “The world is warming. It’s not a hoax. We measure it. The warming has not stopped. All the warmest years are recent years. The evidence for warming is not a weak thread. It’s a strong rope. The atmosphere is warming. So is the ocean. Sea level is rising. Ice sheets and glaciers are shrinking. Rainfall patterns and severe weather events are changing. Climate change is real and serious. It’s not a remote threat for the distant future. It’s here and now.” Moreover, he points out the usage of stories can make the theory more compelling, and the utilization of metaphor can make climate change science more acceptable, and the employ of language can make the report more readable. In chapter 8, the author not only gives out something that elicits people’s frustration about the future. On the other hand, he highlights that there is some silver buckshot, though there is no silver bullet. For example, wind power and solar energy are much easier to access in many countries, and their prices are decreasing. Therefore, the curve can be bending if people take action now.

   Ken also points out the communication skills are very necessary to reverse the climate crisis. It has different consequences if a person tells others he is climatarian or freegan instead of vegetarian or vegan. These two terms can trigger people’s interest and make them want to know more about climate change science. People are willing to accept something only when they are curious about it. Hence, it is important to make them get interested in climate change science. Ken also maintains that climatarian and freegan are a lifestyle that people can change in a very short time. However, these two lifestyles can make a huge reduction in CO2 emissions. Thus, it is very necessary to act from a person approach to mitigate the climate crisis.

I totally agree with your comment of what Ken believes the best ways to approach people about climate change. Communication is an important skill to have in today’s world. It is especially important when regarded to topics that are delicate to talk about, such as climate change. I totally agree that the best way to peak someone's interest in a topic such as this is to say things that are interesting to peak their curiosity. I think another way to encourage people to join our cause is talk about how changing to more climate friendly options for eating, transportation, clothes, etc. Instead of telling someone how bad it is that they drive everywhere, say how cool your electric bike is and how convenient it is to get around town. Maybe instead of saying how terrible eating a lot of meat is for the environment, talk about how being a vegan has made you feel healthier then you have ever been and how it was not even all that difficult to switch. While having the government force people to fall in line when it comes to protecting the planet will for the most part work. I believe that we can make the transition faster and easier for people if we explain the benefits of living with a “climate conscious”.

Many aspects of this chapter really intrigued and resonated with me. One of the greatest standouts was a comparison the author repeatedly made about our mindset to our personal health vs our mindset to the climate's health. The author noted that we often take threats to our personal health very seriously when a healthcare professional notes something going wrong. We do not take the same approach when it comes to our deteriorating climate. I find this especially amusing because in some situations, the effects that will come as a result of climate change, will prove to be much more dangerous and destructive. If a doctor were to tell the average citizen they are on the path of pre-diabetes, they would probably begin to make changes to their lifestyles right away to prolong the process and hopefully reverse it. We are currently at that stage in the climate crisis. The only difference is that people are not taking action to mitigate the issue. Instead we are continuing to live our lives however we want which is expediting the process and making it much worse. We need to begin to realize that as our climate continues to deteriorate and warm, the effects we feel are going to be just as serious as threats to our personal health. If we do not take the threats noted by scientists seriously, we will not even have a planet to inhabit. It is crucial for people to have an equally alarmist mindset towards our climate's health that they have with their health. The effects of blowing off our climate will prove to be far worse than a health condition. We need to weigh the severity of our climate crisis as heavy as we weigh the severity of our personal health and realize they are very interconnected.

I too think that it's amusing that people are taking threats to their personal health more seriously than threats to our climate's health. The general public may begin to change this opinion when the effects of the threats to the climate starts becoming more apparent. However, it would likely be too late by then. I think one of the reasons why people are not taking climate changes more serious is how informations relating to climate changes have been exposed to the public. It's really hard for ordinary people to get access to scientific articles that accurately report findings about the climate. Only when well known news outlets report the articles do the general public get the information; even then, the scientific language used in the articles are still not the best for public understanding.


<br><hr>
I think the reason people are more likely to be more threatened from their personal health as opposed to the climate deteriorating is because climate change doesn't directly affect them yet. People need to see it to believe it. I'm honestly surprised that media outlets don't cover more about climate change. It's a real thing! But I do agree how eventually everyone will be more concerned about the planet in a matter of years as the earth gets warmer and will be just as serious as our health.

Communicating Climate change to people like "Uncle pete" or even your friends, seems like a challenge that most people will undertake (at the very least those who are climate activist) in the class. I think many people think that convincing or explaining climate change is almost akin to a religious conversion. I don't blame them to be honest. Many of things we must do to save the planet involve cultural and societal changes to our daily lives--like changing our eating habits and attitudes towards goods to name a few. This is why chapter 8 in Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions is so important. For example, one thing the chapter points out is that it is important to be self aware of the audience you are speaking to, and the knowledge you are well versed in. Knowing your subject is important, especially to an audience that doesn't believe or isn't knowledgeable on climate change. The better we have an understanding on climate change, the better we can explain it to others. There is also the case in which people question your knowledge. I get this a lot from my friends when I tell them for example " oh hey, airplane travel is pretty bad for the environment" and they respond "oh who told you that" or " are you sure about that"? The remedy to this of course, is to direct those people who question your knowledge into reputable resources.  This is the type of conversations Uncle Pete might have and being able to effectively communicate with others is important to spreading the word about climate change.

This week’s reading makes it clear that environmental activism is not merely about the scientific evidence presented in your argument but the ways in which you shape and present your argument to an audience. My favorite part of this reading was the recognition that climate policy is not a scientific dilemma because climate itself is a “rich tapestry of interlinked phenomena, multifaceted and inherently complex;” therefore, to change the perception of climate change as a partisan issue, we need to understand how the problem shapes all of our lives in many ways, from social equality to human health. To explain this point, the section on metaphors offers a very good comparison of our planet’s health to our own bodies. The author states that a fever, for example, is only an indicator of a bigger health problem; considering the fever alone is not enough for doctors to diagnose their patients. In a similar manner, the dilemmas we are encountering today, from the melting of ice sheets to the resource inequality in vulnerable coastal communities, are symptoms of a global climate crisis. 

  	                            <br><br>

 Yet, as Ken indicates in his lecture, even bringing up the climate crisis is a problem in it of itself. Acknowledging that the “time and place” for these conversations is difficult to recognize helped me understand why Ken argues that it is best to wait until the topic is brought up. Then, when it is discussed, it is important to be vigilant in your choice of words so as to incite deeper, more personal conversation. Although this option may seem much more passive than initiating a climate conversation, I personally found that is often most effective because it makes room for a more sincere discussion that also allows you to practice your preferred methods of communication.

I enjoy the writing of Somerville in Chapter 8 of Bending the Curve because he lays out communication of climate change in an understandable and clear way that will help readers find the tools they need to talk about climate change with others. The comparison of climate change scientists and medical doctors is one that can put the climate crisis into perspective for a denier and hopefully, allow them to see that based on the science, climate change is real. It’s true that generally, people don’t question doctors, so, they accept their diagnosis or advice, but when it comes to scientists giving the prognosis of our Earth, people disagree. The chapter served as a how-to guide which I found easy to follow and definitely helpful in my own understanding of the climate crisis. I don’t think I have my own “Uncle Pete” in my personal life, but I know that there are a lot out there and if anything, I would use these tips to communicate with my friends and family about climate change even if they are already “believers”. A big takeaway from the guide for me was how to prepare for a climate-based conversation and having your facts in order along with solid and factual rebuttals for possible things a denier may say. A sentence in the text that stook out to me was, “In deciding climate policy, science matters, but so do values, priorities, and political convictions” because in class we did the poll about what matters most in mitigating climate change: personal action, climate activism, or political action and I along with this quote, I too believe that it’s a combination of all three aspects.

As for the video, I’m on the same boat with Ken in the sense of not talking about my diet unless it comes up. Naturally, topics concerning what I eat and climate change do arise in certain situations so I think that’s a good time to talk casually about the reasons why I eat plant-based since the environmental reasons are definitely a factor. I hadn’t heard the term climatarian before this class, but I believe it’s an effective way of consuming food and makes being environmentally friendly through food much less daunting since you don’t have to necessarily cut anything out. Because many people out there simply will not become vegan or vegetarian, this is a great way to get most people to at least try. The consciousness and intention behind food choices will soon become a normal thing for people to consider and thus will help in the grand scheme of things.

This film tells how the the director protects the environment by changing his own life style. For example, he refuses to take the airplane when he need to travel. Also, he uses waste vegetable oil instead of fossil fuels. He usually rides bike to travel. Only doing these things may not have a big impact on global warming, but if there are more people who follow the director, we will reduce much more carbon emissions than we can imagine. I believe that there will be more and more people who will have the awareness of protecting environment in the future, because lots of scientists concern about our planet like the director and appeal more and more people to be environmental friendly. The film uses a relatively large space to talk about meditation. The film says that meditation can help understand the relationship between people and people and the nature. I think meditation is really useful for people living in the urban area. They can relax with meditation, also get closer to the nature by it. The only fly in the ointment is that the movie is boring because it is only recording the narrator’s daily life. There is no over-rendered theme for protecting the environment. So if the audience finish watching this documentary, they may just praise the protagonist's perseverance and behavior. But if the consequence is taht the audience will follow Peter, it is not convincing. So I will not recommend this movie to my friends, although I admire Peter’s lifestyle.

I generally feel optimistic and rational about saving the planet. From one side it is true that it’s so urgent to start protecting the planet, but on the other side, with the efforts that people keep spending, it is not too late. With the intelligence of humans, we already invented energy-efficient ways, such as wind energy, pipe transformation for fossil fuels, and solar energy. Moreover, people find that little changes in human transportation, such as keep biking, is also valuable for saving the planet. But one thing i do feel pessimistic about is the attitude from the government about protecting the environment. Since governments do have connections with large companies which have conflicts with saving the planets, they lose actions and movements towards it. As an official agency, it is important for it to show an attitude to guide the citizens.

I intuitively knew that climate change communication was just as important as individual or collective action, but I didn’t ever think that it may be best to not initiate talking about climate change or your personal actions to those who aren’t skeptics. However, after Ken explained it, it made perfect sense. You don’t want to make people feel guilty or uncomfortable for not taking action, because they will be much less likely to listen. If you wait until they are ready to act, and then educate them, the outcome will likely be more effective than otherwise. I really enjoyed Ken’s stories of explaining his diet choices while having dinner with friends. As a lifelong vegetarian myself, I completely understand what he was trying to explain about people being defensive or uninterested when it is brought up. People usually jump straight to explaining why they would not be able to give up meat, which I completely understand - that’s why I love the idea of climatarian. It’s a lot more approachable of an idea because it doesn’t require commitment or radical lifestyle changes. It merely means making conscious decisions about what is better for the environment, even if it is just some of the time. The effectiveness of a more realistic/approachable diet change is clear in Ken’s example, where his friends made a decision to have a more climate friendly meal right then and there, and were interested in learning more, rather than being put off by the idea of giving up meat altogether. As Ken mentioned it would be more effective for the majority of Americans to cut their footprint in half, than 5-10% switching to a plant based diet. 
  	                            <br><br>
I have to admit that I really did view the freegan diet as sort of “dumpster diving”. But after Ken explained that making freegan decisions really consists of eating what’s on your plate or finishing your leftovers it seems 100% realistic. Even buying “expired” food from grocery stores doesn’t even sound so terrible because most of it is still edible anyways. Of all of Ken’s videos, this is one of the ones that resonated with me most -  I learned so much from it despite that it didn’t include climate change statistics or even list out actions that should be taken to combat it.

I completely agree with you about how this reading and this video clarified my perspective about communicating effectively about climate change and our part in it. I was vegetarian for a year and then pescatarian for two before I came to UCSB. At first, it was solely because I wanted to see how I felt physically but then I realized that by just changing my diet, I was reducing my carbon footprint. I began telling others what I was doing and why. My audience was annoyed because I was spewing information at them, rather than having a conversation. Through this class, I have learned that some people just aren't educated in the same way I am. I have learned to converse rather than lecture, and now I can have conversations with people about. I wish courses like this were required for every student, starting in elementary school.

For someone who has read a lot of literature on climate change and even had multiple debates about the magnitude, probability, and impact of climate change, I still find it difficult communicating how serious of a problem climate change is to my peers without resisting the urge to simply send them a bunch of articles and papers concerning climate change so they can understand what I failed to explain. I appreciated this week's reading that much more as it made me realize how to engage audiences that don't want to just hear scientific facts and evidence. I myself found the exemplary sports metaphors in the reading to be effective as I know my target audience would find it effective as well. It never occurred to me that people perceive certain words differently especially if they aren't familiar with hearing or seeing those words in different contexts. I hope that I can be conscious of all the points presented in the chapter whenever I attempt to communicate anything about climate change and it's certainly a reading worth recommending to my peers.

I relate to your frustration when it comes to communicating with others about the climate crisis. Some of my close friends, including my boyfriend, are very stubborn and so it’s difficult not to be too overbearing when speaking about how the earth is dying because I tend to bring it up a lot or recommend videos or articles. This reading was very informational and easy to read, which is one of their points of making conversations simple and straightforward. Know what you’re talking about, use stories and metaphors, avoid jargon, and keep your conversation optimistic. As a communication major I appreciated all these tips and can verify some of them are taught in public speaking.

I especially enjoyed the Uncle Pete story, and how you need to understand why denialists think the way they do before trying to converse with them. I thought the explanations were very well worded and actually answered questions I myself have had. It makes sense how “Doing nothing will force the government to do exactly what Uncle Pete fears most: seize power and limit freedoms” and how you cannot give a scientific explanation to someone who does not see the climate crisis as a scientific issue.

 Ken’s video was also one of my favorites of this entire quarter, and I agreed with everything he said. I think it is very smart to wait until people ask questions to explain your ideas to them, because as I said I can see how I can become annoying if I constantly bombard my friends with facts and explanations I’ve learned in class. I also think I’m going to start labeling myself a climatarian (and will only explain if someone asks). I’ve always reduced food waste because of my upbringing, and because of this class I’ve reduced my beef consumption and I try to choose more plant based foods but still eat other meats.

I honestly really liked reading chapter 8 from "Communicating Climate Change Science". One thing that I think is an issue with the climate crisis is that a lot of people aren't really educated about the topic. If we could communicate the events occurring right now better, I honestly think a lot people's opinions would change. If you have facts and are intentional in your delivery there's really no way someone wouldn't at least hear you out and consider your position.

I agree with you! However, even though people may have all the facts, it is still sometimes difficult for them to reach others who don't even want to be reached. It's just a very unfortunate occurrence that happens way more often than it should. Despite that, I sincerely hope that everyone in this class (including myself!) uses the tips this reading gave to try and change even just a few peoples' minds about climate change. Ideally, it would be nice to do this on a large scale, but even if we all just had a couple of people hear our voices it could still make some of an impact.

One thing that was made really transparent to me with this reading was the fact that the only people who truly have the data and the answers to the climate crisis are climate scientists who speak with scientific data and the Uncle Petes the ones who deny the climate crisis, who disregard science. I think it is because of this terrible match up that we still have deniers in our country, the ones who mistake temperature for the weather. This is why companies like Exxon have had influence for so long; their pro-fossil fuel propaganda does not emphasize the science, instead, they put their success in terms of economy and progress, something that the Uncle Petes understand. At this point, no scientific data could influence the deniers, for they can just cherry-pick and keep on denying. This is why I enjoyed this reading so much because it points out the wide gap of knowledge between the ones who have the answers and the ones who don't, but ironically the ones who don't have knowledge are the ones with the most voting power, and thus it is very important that the scientists can communicate in such a way that does not alienate the Uncle Petes, and only then will true change come.

I agree that climate change is much more than science. In a previous comment, I elaborated on my mother not wanting to give up beef because of religious reasons, and after reading about having the right people communicate climate change to others, I realized how big of an aspect communicating this topic correctly really is, and how so many components fall within this topic. I bet if my mother had a conversation about climate change with Christian climate scientist, Katharine Hayhoe, her viewpoints would be substantially different due to words coming from someone who is both knowledgeable on the subject, and also has similar beliefs.

I really liked the analogy of climate change being like a fever. There are several symptoms of a fever, but the most significant and easy-to-point-out one is when your body temperature increases. That is very much the case for climate change. I agreed with the text that the label “climate change” is quite incorrect for this phenomenon. Again, there are so many components that fall within what humans consider “climate change” that many fail to recognize or consider, such as the role animal agriculture plays, as well as refrigerant management in households. Seeing how climate change was being communicated in the text was really eye opening to me. The “Uncle Pete” reference was amazing, considering we all know someone like what the text described. With this, the six principles at the end of chapter 8 were very well-received, and do a good job at showing the reader how to refute their Uncle Pete. 
  	                            <br><br>

Furthermore, I noticed that climate change is communicated quickly and concisely. The facts are not only there, but straight to the point. For those who fail to not believe in climate change, the book states “this massive degree of misunderstanding may be due in part to a failure to educate people about science.” I couldn’t agree more. Like we’ve talked about earlier in the quarter, educators/teachers play a pivotal role in how young people view the climate crisis, which varies from what this crisis is, to if it is real or a hoax. These children later turn into adults who may see this crisis as a joke because of what was instilled in their minds during their youth. This is unfair and really makes me question America’s educational systems. Speaking of unfair, I couldn’t help but come to the realization that the word does view medical discoveries as more important than climate discoveries. I think humans need to 1) comprehend what is happening to the earth from atmospheric warming, and 2) realize that their well-being is/will be affected if serious action is not taken urgently. If this were to happen, humans would be more prompted to vote for and support politicians who care about this topic, and we would hopefully see a decline in the trend of atmospheric warmth.

The way climate change information has been spread has led to a serious setback in allowing skeptics/non-believers to change their opinions on the subject. A climate scientist who advocates for limiting anthropogenic-caused climate change will inevitably use scientific language not in hopes of convincing the public but in aims of convincing fellow scientists and getting his/her paper into a peer-reviewed journal. It is not until a journalist comes into the picture and reports the story to the public, given that the paper holds something new that people will actually take interest in. Even if the journalist accurately reports the story without an alarming preface, there is still a very little change that people on the other side will accept the reported findings.

I believe there are three main problems for this besides the ones listed in the readings.

  	                            <br><br>

1. Desensitization of the problem.
   	                            <br><br>

- People are becoming desensitized to the issue because of the numerous articles being blasted in the media. The only way to stop this is by releasing something besides , "The Earth is warming much faster than we anticipated, The Planet is doomed if we don't change now"... I know these are necessary headlines to get people interested in the article, but nobody wants to hear it three or four times a day. People won't change their view -- they'll just believe this is the media spinning misinformation.

  	                            <br><br>

2. A lack of story.
   	                            <br><br>

- As humans we crave information, and throughout history the easiest way to accept and understand an issue is through a coherent narrative. We won't be able to empathize with an issue if there is no emotional connection to it. There are a variety of methods to implement here: Megafauna, Climate Refugees, Economic peril! Without a story we can't connect to seemingly arbitrary numbers. There is conviction behind a convincing story.

  	                            <br><br>

3. I don't think a bottom-up approach to the situation is useful. 

  	                            <br><br>

- Convincing your Uncle Pete of the climate change issue isn't going to do much for the future. Maybe convincing the entirety of your community will, but not by much -- not with the little time we have. If any change needs to occur, it will start from the top. The people who are in charge of businesses, the people with connections to these businesses, politicians.. etc. To convince them that change needs to occur will require a story to which then convincing your community of an issue will help. Strength comes in numbers, but if there is no outlet for that, then there will be no solution.

However, after climate scientists have published their studies or findings in these scientific journals, their job isn’t completed yet. They should then focus their effort on addressing the general public because most of them have no clue what’s going on unless you’re personally invested in climate change. The role of a journalist is just as important as a climate scientist. The two roles should work together to inform the public through publication outlets. The combination of these two forces have much more power than any organization alone.

It’s crucial to incorporate the main message in the opening of your piece, or else the audience might lose interest very quickly. Having that information is not enough, you have to be able to make a personal connection with the audience to keep them engaged and informed. I think it’s essential for the authors to urge for action or else the audience will just stay sedentary.

I really like how you came up with three more issues that aren’t listed in the reading. I totally agree with your view on how repetitiveness can lower the interest of anyone. I think part of this course is kind of making me feel the same way. I like learning new information but once it’s being repeated I would kind of just zone out. I think the public is the same. Therefore, we need to come up with new ways to present this information in a way that’s captivating and will keep the incentive going. The aspect of story is similar to the film portion of our assignments. I love the PBS documentaries. I think those make climate change relatable. Maybe in our country a bottom-up movement may not work as well as a top-down but finding the right way to the solutions is more important than being fixated upon something that isn’t working. I’ve only heard about the Jeff Bezos’s funds but not the BlackRock so thank you so much for sharing that. And I think Bezos set a great example to leaders in multiple sectors as his influence can make a difference more than what we do on a daily basis.

I too agree that the way climate change and its dangers have been spread has allowed skeptics/non-believers to change their opinions and present non-truths to the world due to a lack of understanding. I also agree that these scientists use their scientific terms as a way to be published and recognized within the science community but I also believe that they should not only be appeasing to the science community but to regular citizens as well. Like one sees at a doctor, the doctor never talks to you solely with medical jargon, but utilizes both medical jargon and an explanation that they know their client will understand. For example, when getting an MRI or procedures they will provide you with the doctor's report that contains medical jargon. While they use medical jargon on the paper, they then talk to the patient personally in order to explain what is on the paper and how that will either negatively or positively affect the patient. The community of climate change scientists, while still appealing to their fellow scientists, need to be able to replicate the communities of other sciences as they have gained more respect within the community than climate change has. I do not think they should "dumb down" or rid of their scientific jargon, but I do think that providing an explanation and appealing more to the average citizen would be more influential.

I too agree with you Ryan that the subject of climate change has been desensitized as communicating about an issue can only go so far if there are only a few phrases and requests being made. The world has heard that "the earth is warming" and sadly, it has become almost a joke among the vast majority of people. The climate change scientists need to, like said above, have a story that pertains to the public and lets them understand how it is affecting them now and, in a way, bring an element of guilt in. As activists, they need to find a way to grab the attention of those that believe climate change was created by the government as a way to obtain more control over the people and alter their viewpoints while making them realize that, like a extensive surgery, all things come with risks and dangers but they can only get worse if the issue is left untouched. Activists need to find a way to desensitize the people of the world, especially those of the older generations and open their minds to the vast advances we could see in technology that could better the environment, eventually the economy, and the future of the planet as we know it.

Ken states in this video that communication strategy also leverages personal climate action not only these actions have a direct impact on the crisis but they encourage others to act as well when they underscore how serious you take this crisis. This week’s reading is chapter 8 the “Communicating Climate Change Science” from the book Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions. This chapter is divided into five sections: preparation, stories, metaphors, language, and solutions, which can be viewed as five important steps to become a skillful and effective communicator of climate change science. This first step is preparation. Preparation requires the communicator to have adequate knowledge of climate change science and access to valuable sources. In addition, the communicator also needs to know the general principle of communication. The second step is the stories. Convey important messages to your audience by telling a story is a wonderful way to engage them. The third step is metaphors. In communicating the science of climate change, comparing climate change with something people are well-known is a clever skill to make it easier for the audience to understand climate change. The fourth step is language. It is important that communicators use different languages when they reach different audiences. The final step is the solutions. Communicating with the audience is the first step; more importantly, we should give them the solutions that let them know what they can do to solve the problem. I found this reading pretty interesting because I never thought that communication needs that many skills. I thought communication is just you telling others your ideas, and that is all. After reading this chapter, I learned that effective communication needs much more than I thought, and the five steps are very important when we communicate with others. In order to tackle climate change, personal action is not enough, we have to let more and more people know how serious the situation is and encourage them to act. How can we achieve this? The answer is communication.

Professor Hiltner has taken a very understanding route about this, He is undoubtedly very passionate about the environment but he doesn't force his beliefs on others, rather he educatees and seeks to learn rather than force. I understand those that try to defend the planet by resorting to more and more aggressive methods but taking a step in that direction is taking two steps away from a solution as we need to come together as a nation to enact the changes we need.

As Somerville puts it we all have an 'Uncle Pete' a person disbelieving of even basic scientific principles and to me, a scientist working in a lab here in UCSB, I can't find any time of day to give people who talk about science as if they received multiple Ph.D.'s in proving science doesn't exist. I don't think I can convince a flat earther of anything because they aren't uneducated they are educated in fake science that to them makes perfect sense. The same group of people overlaps with climate change deniers, the fact is we have no choice but to either seize power or through an act of god ;make these people see reason.

I really enjoyed this reading because it brought up points that I haven’t thought about but are very very important. Communication is so crucial in all matter of life from relationships all the way to things such as climate change. Speaking or writing clearly so that your point is easily understood by others is key to getting your opinion across to the majority of people. The author said that the biggest mistake scientists make is that the write these long and wordy papers with scientific words that the average person simply can’t comprehend. Most of us don’t know the definition of half of the words they writing, therefore, we aren’t going to read the paper. We can’t expect people to be knowledgable in all aspects of life if people are going to produce papers that require a PHD to understand. The author also mentioned that there are a lot of words that scientists often use that have an almost opposite meaning to the general public. For example, if a scientist uses the term “positive feedback” a person who has no science education would think they are talking about a good response or praise; meanwhile, they are actually using it in terms of a vicious cycle or self- reinforcing cycle. The author makes it very clear that scientist who are publishing papers that are directed toward the public need to realize that a straightforward fact is going to be registered by the reader way better than a lengthy paragraph with big, scientific words. You want to convince people, not confuse them. With people already being on the fence about whether climate change is a hoax or not, we need to be giving them accessible information that will keep them reading instead of deterring them.

I agree.  When it comes to papers about climate change that are produced by scientists, they are often lengthy with complex concepts and confusing jargon for the public to understand.  This in turn makes it less likely for people to read the paper, much less actually know what it is talking about.  There is definitely a disconnect between climate scientists and the public as there is a knowledge gap.  It actually isn’t the climate scientists fault.  For countless years of schooling, research, training, and work, the in-depth scientific writing has been ingrained in them so they don’t really know anything other than what they have always done.  In addition, it is not the fault of the public that they do not understand the topics of these complex papers or the in-depth jargon of scientists because it took the scientists years to develop their knowledge and hone in their skills, so everyone can’t be expected to understand with experience and knowledge.  Therefore, what is needed is to bridge the gap between the scientists and the public.  While it would be great to both have scientists improve their communication skills to properly explain the climate crisis and its various aspects in understandable terms to the public and the public to be able to understand more complex concepts and jargon found within the scientific papers, neither is completely possible as there will always be those in each group who resist the change or are unwilling to alter their ways.  I think this is exactly where climate activists and those who are passionate about the climate crisis and education of the public comes in.  These people are the bridge between the two worlds and can help provide information to the masses.  In this sense, these people are able to understand and interpret the findings and papers of the scientists and explain it to the public in such a way that they are able to understand and grasp the concept of the climate crisis.  Education is very important so this communication bridge is essential for more people to see and understand our current situation so that they are able to be conscious about their decisions and act accordingly.

A prevalent issue in science is communication. This was seen in the documentary we watched about the heartland institute and climate deniers where the NASA scientist came off as confusing, rattling off stats and jargon whereas the heartland institute folks were short and to their point. If one didn't know any better (and many Americans don't) they would have believed the heartland institute over NASA when it came to climate change. Be honest, it was way easier to read the heartland institute paper debunking climate change than some figure-heavy scientific paper. It is becoming increasingly important for scientists to not only have excellent analytical skills, but also written and spoken communication. In the end, what is the good of doing all this science if it can't be effectively communicated to the public and the government? It is almost as if sometimes scientists need a translator to put things into terms the every-man can understand.
<br><hr>
I really liked your reply to my comment as I hadn't thought about it that way. Your reasoning makes total sense, these climate scientologists have been through so much schooling and been taught exactly how they need to be writing their papers that it makes sense they aren't going to "dumb-down" their scientific findings. They want to be taken professionally by their scientist peers and so that is how they must produce their findings. However. it really can't be the general publics fault either as they didn't go through this intense schooling. I totally agree that it is the job of middle man to form that bridge., To understand the climate scientologists and also be able to explain the information is a simpler way to the rest of the public. I believe that we are experiencing this every Monday Wednesday and Friday in lecture as Ken is quite perfectly the bridge between the scientists and the common people.

Although the concept of Freeganism may seem “gross” to most people, I certainly see how beneficial it would be to society as a whole. There is a homeless shelter that I volunteer at and they get all of their food as donations from Trader Joes. Just like with Freeganism, this is food that was required to be taken off shelves and is being donated to feed those who are less fortunate. I personally think that this is an amazing system that should be implemented in more areas. As demonstrated by the video and by my experiences, often times the food that is marked as expired is still good. This creates an extraordinary amount of food waste that is completely unnecessary.
  	                            <br><br>
I really liked the way that Ken addressed discussing climate activism. By not forcing your lifestyle onto others and instead on inviting curiosity of others, healthier space for conversation is provided. I think that this would especially be helpful in the case of Freeganism. Because the concept would seem bizarre to the general public, it is important not to present it as overbearing and alienate your audience. 
  	                            <br><br>
I think that if you really presented your audience with the statistics regarding the amount of food that grocery stores wasted, they would see how logical Freeganism actually is. While there might certainly be opponents, I think that by following the Freegan example implemented at the local homeless shelter, we can find a way to implement Freegan practices into our current society without forcing it into our current lifestyles. This would not require any lifestyle change on the part of the general public and would benefit the people in the shelters as well as the environment. By saving this food from immediately going into landfills, this allows us to reduce food waste while also helping the disadvantaged.  
  	                            <br><br>
By presenting Freeganism in this light, it becomes much more logical while still having the same effect on the environment. If we were to present Freeganism by describing statistics of the amount of food waste that an average American produces, our audience might feel attacked. By focusing on the positive impacts and articulating the benefits of the system, we would invite the curiosity of the audience without making them self-conscious about their current lifestyle.

I agree with your comment. I think when most people think "freeganism," they think dumpster diving and pulling out old moldy food, like something you'd see on the show "Extreme Cheapskates". But we know that this is very far from the reality of it. Last year while living in the dorms and eating at the dining commons for every meal really made me put food waste into perspective. We weren't allowed to take food out of the commons, but hundreds of pounds of perfectly good food got shoveled into the trash after every meal. There must be something more beneficial that can be done will all that food other than just wasting it. And taking it one step further into the grocery stores, we see how much is truly wasted. There is no possible way a store can sell all their food before its past its "sell by" date, but just because we are past that date doesn't mean the food is inedible. I personally have never really participated in freeganism, besides maybe the occasional stop to the food bank, which I don't even think counts, but maybe it's something I should consider for the future.

Communication is important, and this week’s article takes on the climate of explaining the reality of climate science to skeptics. A lot of us have our own “Uncle Pete” we have to deal with. That guy who doesn’t believe climate change is real. It is vital for climate activists to be able to talk to climate deniers and help them understand where we are coming from.

It took me a while to understand when Ken said we should not be the ones to start the discussion, but I finally understood that we must firstly lead by our actions. I feel for my vegan friends because some people don’t react accordingly and make “vegan” jokes. It always gets uncomfortable. People go vegan for all sorts of reasons, and I feel bad that there’s a stereotype behind being vegan, vegetarian, freegan, etc. Climitarians eat with the climate in mind, whereas a vegetarian might choose a turkey burger over a beef one simply because they don’t like red meat. I appreciate anyone who tries to shift their eating habits away from eating meat and more plant-based. In this day and age it’s important to keep the planet in mind. Meat substitutes are becoming more and more common, and I’m excited to see what future chefs come up with.

The view of these parties that seek to be more environmentally friendly and raise awareness of the human population’s impact on the planet they live on is unfortunately stigmatized. I would blame this on the negative projections of these groups in the media and the social stereotypes that circulate through our speech, like you acknowledged in your comment. As a whole, I think we should acknowledge the impact their small lifestyle changes are making on our environment and perhaps pull inspiration from their actions. In addition to this, it would do wonders to the climate crisis if the lifestyles adopted by the people in these groups are positively depicted in advertisements in promotion of associating products. Tying the data collected by climate change scientists from different aspects of the issue to the benefits of making these lifestyle choices would provide credibility and logical reasoning as to why the people with these lifestyles choose what they choose. Hopefully, this publicity would make these choices more trendy and spark more people to reconsider their views upon all of it.

Page 25 of Chapter 8 talks about an important concept that everyone should recognize and talk about. When people hear that the global average temperature went up by more than two degrees Celsius, they usually do not understand the severity of this problem. They think, “we experience hot and cold days all the time, what does 2 degrees even do? I can’t even feel a change of two degrees.”
  	                            <br><br>
“Going into the ice age, to involve one example, involves a global cooling of only a few degrees.” People think of the ice age as an uninhabitable period of history when species died off at an exponential pace. We’re experiencing the same thing right now, except in the other direction. What would people think now if they equated our next extinction crisis to the ice age? But this time, it is man-made.
  	                            <br><br>
If articles, films, and activists started making this connection, people will undoubtedly realize the severity of our situation right now. We should stop saying that there is a 2 degree Celsius rise in temperature, but rather note that if this continues, we will really be living in an uninhabitable Earth.

The reading of "Communicating Climate Change Science" was shockingly simple in its methodology of communication. That method was to simplify as much as possible. The clear concise language that they encouraged people to use was in an effort to prevent the risk of an individual feeling alienated with complex information. One of the better points that the author made was the fact that many climate change denialists don't know scientists, and that people usually tend to trust the people that share their beliefs. Through this context, it becomes clear why climate change denialists do not believe scientists. The analogy of Uncle Pete resonated with me because I have someone in my life who is represented by this metaphor and who is inherently mistrustful of anything remotely liberal. Because of Uncle Pete's beliefs and his lack of trust for the government, he will never be willing to accept the truth from anyone associated with either of those things. The challenge is to establish legitimacy in some other way. Through communication and logical discussion, the author argues that an effective argument for climate change can be made. However, this would only be the case for some who is a logical arguer. Some people get very emotional when they argue, leaving intellect out of the conversation because they don't like being told that they're wrong. I hate to say it, but my Uncle Pete is unlikely to ever be convinced of climate change because of his emotional tendencies.

I really resonated with Ken's video about climatarianism as a way to combat prejudice and invite conversation on environmental lifestyle choices. One joke that I head a few years back was the question of how a vegan cross fitter would introduce themselves: would they say that they're vegan or would they day that they do cross fit first? This joke plays into the notion that vegans are conceited about their moral high ground. This unfortunate stereotype not only antagonizes vegans, but also makes the lifestyle seem unappealing. However, practicing climatarianism and subtly brining it up in conversation invites conversation on what it actually is. Something I really appreciated that Ken said was that climatarians don't have to be purists. While being a purist is great, I think that following a purist vegan or. vegetarian diet may seem daunting to many people because of the amount of discipline that it takes to follow. By being non-purist, climatarians still have the flexibility of choosing what they want to eat as well as not have the guilt associated with breaking the rules of a certain diet.

I relate to the comment you made about vilifying vegan lifestyle choices as it makes the lifestyle unappealing, but unfortunately, stereotypes are created because they have some truth to them. I have been vegan since my sophomore year of high school, and even though I never talked about it, my friends wouldn’t flame me for it because I was “chill” about my veganism. I have never really been the one to “flaunt” the fact that I have been able to maintain this lifestyle, or make people think that they are lesser than me for not following a strict plant-based diet. It’s a personal choice, and to be honest I don’t even really like talking about it. However, if people ask me about why or how I am vegan, then I’ll answer, short and sweet. Like Ken said, no one wants anything pushed down their throat. There is a sense of resistance to veganism solely based upon the behavior of the people who practice it, sometimes it's almost embarrassing for me to admit to people that I am vegan because of the way that people will perceive me after the fact. With this being said, I do think it's important to educate people on ethical ways of eating foods and creating a sustainable diet that doesn’t hurt the environment further, and even veganism does not hit all the bases with that. In my life I have been fortunate enough to have access to local produce that don’t take tons of carbon to get to me, as the farmer’s market has always been a huge thing in my home town and is accessible in Goleta and Santa Barbara as well (for those who can afford it, it’s really expensive in comparison to where I’m from which is kind of unfortunate for those who are trying to lower their carbon footprint and can’t because of the costs). However, the majority of foods from supermarkets come from thousands of miles away, and vegan alternatives are packaged and produced in various different places to make the end product, which is a bit problematic when making the switch. That is why I find Ken’s point of climatarianism important, and almost more realistic for most, being that many people do not want to cut out meat from their diets (even though dairy should go because cows and methane etc) can consciously make a choice of where they are getting their meat from. There’s always the moral aspect of eating meat but that also is personal, some people do not really care about that so as long as they are trying to be environmentally conscious on the matter then that is an amazing shift. Buying locally sourced is probably, in my opinion, the best choice anyone can make, however it is unfortunate that in some places, such as Santa Barbara, it is more expensive to do so. If possible, it would be amazing if we were able to sell these local products at an affordable price so people would have more of an incentive to switch to a more climate conscious diet.

I enjoyed this section of reading from the book Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions. In this chapter Uncle Pete, a fictional character, is introduced as a firm nonbeliever in climate change. By creating “Uncle Pete,” the audience is able to learn practical ways to rebut climate change deniers. As a reader, I thought it was beneficial for the book to list actual examples of things a real life Uncle Pete would say to try to deny climate change. For instance, atmospheric CO2 amount increases from natural causes, not humans is something he would say. They then continue to list scientific evidence to disprove Uncle Pete’s claim. I also thought it was interesting for the book to point out that the reason people like Uncle Pete are so stubborn and hard to persuade is because they don't think of climate change as a scientific issue, rather a political one. They are afraid climate change is a ploy in order to take away personal freedoms.

I learned about the climate crisis and personal solutions in the previous courses. The book Bending the Curve: Communicating Climate Change Science” further enlarges the things that I can do to change the situation. It illustrates a useful way about how to introduce climate change to others and effectively encourage people who doubt it to take action. I agree that communication skills play an essential rule in spreading the idea to others, in fact, it is more important than we thought. Just as the author and professor Ken said, if I simply say the truth and list statistic data and every possible solution to someone have no knowledge background of climate change, it will probably lead to counteraction. People will contradict my idea and deny to follow my advice. It is better to use a more understanding method to explain climate change to others, such as storytelling. I can use an interesting, less boring tone to introduce the terrible result of wasting food and driving cars. Additionally, don't be too rush to push others to change their current lifestyle in a few minutes. It takes time to adapt to new information and to make vital changes. Huge transformations are made step by step rather than at once. For example, in the video, Ken mentions that it is impossible to ask a person to give up eating meat immediately, but it is much easier to let someone choose a pizza with more vegetables next time.

I agree with Gina: creating the character of Uncle Pete is easy for a lot of people to relate to. Almost everyone can say that they have met a climate change denier that has tried to prove why increasing temperatures is not caused by humans. One of the most prominent comparisons using Uncle Pete was the idea to “do nothing.” Deciding to not do anything about climate change is like deciding not to have serious elective surgery, which would have risks and costs like a fatal heart attack. I think this is a very eye-opening comparison: people wouldn’t even have a second thought whether or not to get a major surgery if their life was on the line. However, when it is “Earth’s life,” people tend to not understand the urgency

I thought that the reading offered realistic advice on how to communicate the climate crisis. The author used metaphors, stories, and language to highlight the different ways that one can help others to understand the truth about the seemingly “political” issue that will affect our planet for generations. By using the character called Uncle Peter to help climate activists/environmentalists understand “his” confusion, we’re offered advice and information so that we can adjust our claims so that they’re comprehensible to him. The author stated that Uncle Peter and those like him believe that the climate crisis is a ploy to place more government regulations in place, interfere with markets and benefit liberals at the expense of others’ freedom. However, the author also notes that Mother Nature is indifferent to politics: it simply comes down to the facts of our actions. Furthermore, in order for scientists’ research and claims to be received clearly and respected inevitably by the public (like medical research, which rarely is questioned by the public), they must cut out jargon so as not to confuse people. Everyday use of words don’t align with the scientific use of that same word, which can create a huge misconception about scientists’ findings. Additionally, scientists tend to place their claims at the ends of their articles which increases the difficulty in the reception of their research.

Ken’s advice on communicating the climate crisis through his personal action in almost a passive way is actually incredibly productive. I was vegan for almost three years, and I’m still mostly plant-based, but in those three years there was a lot of offense taken by my actions, even if I was minding my own business. In the beginning, I was excited about my lifestyle and wanted to tell people about it, but it would usually end in an argument or I would give up the effort. Later, people saw the dedication and consistency and only then did they seem interested. I actually inspired a few people to try it for a few weeks! In my hometown a few years ago, the climate crisis was something unconsidered and never spoken of. Now that the issue is being publicized more with documentaries and climate activism, I’ve seen a growth in my family’s lifestyle choices as well as some friends. When people take the educational aspect about the climate upon themselves, they are much more willing to make a change. The most peaceful activism is to lead by example.

I agree with you and thought that the authors gave great tips to skillfully and effectively communicate climate change science to others. The reading was understandable and easy to comprehend. The reading outlines five major actions one can take to overcome the challenge of communicating the reality of the current climate crisis. I also appreciated how the reading included the relatable, fictitious character Uncle Pete, who served as an example of a climate change denier. The use of Uncle Pete was beneficial because almost everyone knows someone similar to uncle Pete (in that they do not believe climate change). The reading provided scenarios involving uncle Pete and then described how to correctly respond to the situation.

I was intrigued to learn that people have begun to label themselves as "climatarians" instead of vegans. Many people view vegans as hippies and leftists who believe themselves to be morally superior. Ken's video made me realize that, unfortunately, the term vegan has come to have a negative connotation. I have been vegan for two years, but wherever I go to someone’s house for dinner or a meal, I typically say that I am vegetarian and that I also do not eat dairy or eggs. I found that when I would tell people I was vegan they would automatically become defensive and tell me things like “but what about your health?” or “but you cannot get enough protein” or “but don’t you miss steak”. I understand that it is important to lead by example and that communicating through actions is one of the most effective forms of climate activism. However,  I have been thinking; would it be better to be blatant about my veganism at the risk of angering others or should I just advocate for a more flexible diet and reach more people?

Regardless of your diet, I think it is incredibly important to research the relative environmental impacts of different types of foods (whether it is beef or asparagus or coffee). Though this requires additional effort and time, it can dramatically decrease the environmental impact attributable to your food.  I would appreciate it if Ken could make a new graphic about the relative impact of different types of foods.

If I have to choose one title for me, it would be freegan possibly. Truly I am not a vegetarian or vegan, but I am trying to change my diet like eating more vegetable than meat and eating other kind of meat instead of beef. However, the diet for me was based one decade ago, it is very hard for me to shift my diet directly to plant-based diet in a short time. So, instead of changing my lifestyle, I would like reducing my waste. Just like what professor Ken said in the video, using the “appropriate” words can arise the curiosity of the people to attract people for communication. I think we really underrate the power of language. People may not know how powerful the word they use. When I read an article, I definitely will choose simple vocabulary that explains the big word clearly. So as to these people that want to know about the climate change. The accurate and specific words can be very effective for them to understand compared to those big words.

I wouldn't say that I have any Uncle Petes in my family, but there are certainly members of the family that I know aren't taking the climate crisis as seriously as they should due to their lack of a full grasp on the severity of the topic. Thankfully, I'm lucky enough to not have to convince any full blown skeptics. I'm not sure if I would have the persistence to try to convince anyone who believes there is some liberal conspiracy behind the curtain of climate change. However, I was recently speaking to my sister after sending her and my father (both who pride themselves on their strong centralist values) a link to the Green New Deal. My request for them was to read it and to take into mind the positions of candidates on the topic when voting. My sister poked fun at me for spreading my "California propaganda" by trying to persuade them to vote for someone who will seriously address the crisis. I didn't really know how to respond seriously without encouraging her. Luckily, her vote is still up in the air, so who knows. My father, a New Yorker, is loyal to Bloomberg. I've tried to tell him indirectly that there are better choices due to his weak position on the future of the climate, but he's unconvinced. This reading has reminded me that I need to have another more thorough conversation with him, and does a fairly good job explaining how.

My one complaint would be that I find the material very redundant. This criticism applies to many of our reading materials. Sometimes I feel like I'm being presented the same information over and over again, just worded differently. For example, section 8.3 of the chapter is labeled "metaphors", but presents little information about their effectiveness. It just gives a few examples.

I think that Ken brings up a good point by discussing what aspects of climate change we can communicate with each other to initiate action. I think most people believe that climate change is a problem. Many, however, do not really know what steps to take to start contributing towards the cause and/or are too comfortable with their current lifestyles to want to change. I think many people are scared of these sudden changes (after all, we are creatures of habit) which is why it's important for climate change activists to reassure them and reveal the benefits of finding an alternate way of life. For instance, biking to work is a great way for overweight people to get in shape. Eating a primarily vegan diet is cost-effective and increases longevity. Many people assume that to help they have to completely cut out animal products from their diets. This is not true, I believe that we must just eat fewer animal products. The average American ate 220 pounds of meat in 2018; if we just halved that amount, the United States would be emitting 1/6 less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere (beef industry is responsible for 1/3 of global emissions).

   	                            <br><br>

I believe that another element of climate change that scares people is extremes. People tend to think that in order to mitigate the climate crisis they have to make radical changes to their lifestyles. However, by simply cutting out cars out of someone's life he/she will emit 25 percent fewer greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Like Ken mentioned in lecture, electric bike production produces 100 times fewer greenhouse gases than cars and provides adequate zero-emission transportation.

One of my favorite aspects of the book "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" is how it delves deeply into the proper use of language to convince "Uncle Tom's". Instead of being confrontational about non-climate change believers, the author suggests that we should communicate problems more overtly and in more detail so others can get a stronger understanding of why the climate crisis is occurring. This aspect of the book reminds me of Leonardo DiCaprio's documentary with National Geographic "Before the Flood" because instead of being biased and an over-the-top alarmist, DiCaprio remains composed and informative throughout the documentary and visually shows us the harm we have done to our planet. Frustration creates a divide between two people so by manipulating our usage of language to be more formal and informative we can hopefully convince more skeptics to change their opinion.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading through chapter 8 of "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" because it was such an all-encompassing look at how an ordinary citizen is supposed to approach the issue of confronting the climate crisis in their own daily lives, as well as larger-scale solutions that must be tackled by larger organizations. The thing I found the most fascinating and accurate was the discussion about the language of conversation surrounding the conveyance of climate change issues and solutions. What was particularly infuriating to me was the section elaborating how scientific studies ought to be conveyed to the public. The author describes how the painstaking process the climate scientists must go through in order to reach their conclusions cannot be the basis of what their resultant papers describe, as that would bore any disinterested reader. What is infuriating is that real scientific work must necessarily be reduced to what is essentially clickbait by reporters, not climate scientists, in order to gain any real traction from a general, disinterested audience. What is even worse is that this very necessity is what causes skepticism, whereas a large counter-argument is that the people writing articles to spread information about the climate crisis are not climate scientists themselves and thus cannot be trusted, but the articles are only written by reporters and not climate scientists BECAUSE of the need to appeal to a disinterested public. It is a frustrating dynamic that highlights the large issue of conveying real scientific findings to the public.

I totally agree with you in how frustrating it is for scientists who study the climate to convince the public that this is a serious, alarming problem. These scientists dedicate their lives to find groundbreaking research and reach conclusions that all point to climate change being a real, pressing issue, yet the public is misinformed by reporters and climate change deniers to the point where the public is just not interested or confused on the topic. Companies who are against climate change for their own benefit spread misinformation which trickles down into the hands of uninformed citizens, which is harmful in every way possible. The fact that these scientists have their work dismissed due to the selfish motives of others is just frustrating.

When talking about the clickbait by reporters and nonscientists, it reminded me about a reading from the beginning of the quarter. The "Beyond the Limit" reading mentioned how fossil fuel affiliates targeted teachers with their "why scientists are unsure about climate change”, that’s why I’m not surprised with their tactics. 
   	                            <br><br>
I agree with the frustration that comes with the reality of sharing results. Scientists have to make the writing “interesting” to get the results around. Something like this shouldn’t have to be made into something extra. There isn’t time to make everything extra, we must be straightforward and act now.

I found chapter 8 in the book "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" to be a very helpful resource. It listed out tactics that I had been using to communicate climate change. It also highlighted many tactics that I did not follow. One such example is how I tried to argue for the climate crisis with my parents. I did not attempt to communicate this topic and listen to their concerns. Instead I ignored their concerns and appeared to have a holier than thou attitude which immediately closed my parents mind to the topic. Reading this chapter has brought to the forefront of my mind the approach of proper communication that I have known but not used. I was also able to learn some new facts about climate change from this chapter. It gave me a scientific reason for why this climate crisis is not just another natural cycle like the ice age and is instead man made. According to the chapter this is because of the orbital changes that have not been strong enough in recent years to warrant such a dangerous change in temperature.

I agree with the whole notion of a "holier than thou" attitude when it comes to explaining the climate crisis. I mean, I personally haven't gotten to the point of sharing my views with them yet, but I'm glad Ken's intro video and mostly the reading gave me context and insight as to how to communicate to perhaps close minded people. I almost started talking about it with my mom actually, but I didn't go fully in depth, just a mere comment of how bad the earth is right now, and left it at that to see if the conversation would continue or not. It didn't, but we were also out together having fun so I figured it was a conversation for another time. This week's reading pinpointed what I struggled at: communication. Besides the one attempt to explain to my mom, when I did full out go in depth passionately about the issue, all my friend got from it was that I was just promoting veganism. I wasn't, I was explaining methane gas, but at the same time I could see exactly how it looked like I was. When communicating the issue to someone, it's best to avoid the mistake of having a close mind too. Obviously don't fall into the trap of skepticism, but you have to be open to understand where they're coming from, and ease them into the issue's reality.


<br><hr>
I agree with you that sometimes it is hard and frustrating to explain climate change to older generations or people who do not believe in the environmental crisis. It is highly possible that people will shut down the conversation or will not be open minded to listen to other people's opinions. But in order to let more people be aware of climate change and make actions to improve our environment, we need to find an effective way to patiently explain what we learn and know to people who do not understand how urgent it is to save our planet.

Before this, I had never heard the terms "freegan" or "climatarian". I would definitely consider myself a climatarian because although I do still eat meat and animal products, I still like to choose the more environmentally friendly option. Asking people to convert their diets and to go completely vegan is asking a lot. What people need to realize is that going vegan is very difficult and someone cannot just decide to do it overnight. It takes dedication, time, and energy. I wish that I had the willpower to go vegan but I think that a good first step to becoming a vegan would be to try freeganism or climatarianism. They are the less extreme diets that still help in the fight against the climate crisis.

Hi Olivia! I agree with your comment! I had also never heard the terms climatarian or freegan before this video. I always try to make the more environmentally friendly decision like not eating red meat, using a reusable water bottle and bringing my own bags to the store! Therefore, I would also consider myself a climatarian. I agree with you that becoming a vegan over night is very hard but it gives me hope that it took Ken years before he became fully vegan. I really liked kens idea of how to approach a conversation about the climate crisis with someone and how personal actions can help. He made it sound more like a conversation than a convention and I think that's an awesome way to approach it because then people will feel like it was there idea rather than an idea forced upon them. It's like tricking their brain.  The "Uncle Petes" from this reading who think that climate change is just one big myth are very closed minded and don't want to listen to any of the statistical facts but an approach like this may be able to break that barrier.

The science world is separate from that of the common world we all live in and interact on a regular basis. However, this can no longer be the case when discussing climate change. Due to the concerning issues brought about with climate change, the public must take an active role when implementing solutions. As discussed in the reading, the public will be more inclined to take action if they understand what climate change entails. Scientists have to concern themselves in spreading the message of the unprecedented rate of change within a past few decades of our climate using clear messages that are easy to remember, using terms and units understood by the audience, and grasp the audience attention by showcasing the passion and overwhelming need to address the issue. By following these core principles, the public may be more accepting of the scientific facts because they understand the how and why the climate scientist associated natural greenhouse gas emission with climate change and thereby reasoning for the link between the world’s devastating climate with human activity. 
   	                            <br><br>
In my opinion, the unfortunate reality that scientists are unable to communicate their findings with the public is the main reason for people’s unawareness of the issue and inability to see the connections between natural disasters affecting the entire world with climate change. The public looks towards media outlets for information, but how are they meant to be updated with the latest environmental discoveries if the media does not address the global issue, and if they do, it focuses mainly on rising sea levels thereby minimizing the seriousness of other consequences that are predicted to come about from climate change. When issues arise we are quick to blame a specific person or entity, this case, we may be inclined to blame the media for inadequately informing the people. However, this is not an issue but rather an obstacle limiting the open conversation about the course of the planet. Climate scientists have known and come to the consensus that climate change is, in fact, a tangible reality because they have conducted or participated in research that has yielded those conclusions. Yet besides them, who else completely grasps the issue at full? Therefore, to overcome the obstacle, scientists have to be in the frontlines of the environmental crisis discussions so that they can directly speak to the public and explain our planet's climate. Nevertheless, it is not correct to lay all responsibility on scientists, it is also important for the public to educate themselves by asking questions they may have about the claims scientists are advocating. By exploring different resources and comparing the overarching theme shared by online websites speaking about climate change, it will reassure the public that climate change is not a political tactic of liberals or environmentalists to limit freedom or anything concerning politics in that matter, climate change is science based on facts.

One of the most compelling quotes that stood out to me the most in this chapter was how "Medical science has achieved a measure of pervasive respect that climate science can only envy. Journalists covering a medical discovery don’t mistrust researchers and don’t inevitably insist on hearing from “the opposing view.” I agree with your point on how the science world is constantly depicted as this ungodly demon that we must stay away from, when in reality, it is the main force we need to focus on. This quotes stood out to me in particular because it is true and I just never thought of it like that. When doctors state all of these statistics and facts regarding our own health, we never ask for information to back them up or ask another doctor (who might be in the opposing practice) what they think because we just trust them. This attitude should be the same for climate scientists. They are the ones dedicating their lives to save our planet, and yet we constantly undermine their ability because society has forced us to do so. I also agree with you on your point of the public forcing upon this mindset that climate scientists are 1) a hoax 2) not true scientists or 3) alarmists that just want to prove the opposing view wrong. It is hard to be in a field where you are constantly looked down upon by people who don't even know what anthropogenic means, and this needs to change. The effects of climate change have never been the cover story for the news or trended on social media simply because that is not what people are interested in. They are interested in things that bring them drama and excitement, not stories about how our Earth is falling apart because they wouldn't dare bother what the warming of the Arctic meant for our planet. To be simply put, our morals are all wrong. We are living in the worst state of our planet, and we continue to overlook it because it just isn't interesting enough to click it on Twitter. Your argument on how climate scientists should explore different resources to find ways to spread their research better is spot on. If we find a way to do this, a greater change will (hopefully) follow through.

I found "Communicating the Climate Crisis" to be a simple and accessible overview of the climate crisis and its intricacies. I'm glad it delves into the concept of an "Uncle Pete" and provides the perspective of those who deny climate science. It pretty much summed up everything you need to know to take action, share what you have learned with others, or to sit down and have a conversation with someone who may not be convinced by climate science. Another aspect of the reading that I felt to be incredibly important was the discussion of language. Scientists definitely need to make their findings accessible and simple enough to describe to an everyday person. Fortunately, this reading does exactly that. Moreover, I appreciated the optimism of the reading. Its reassurance and description of the vast amounts of world leaders and even corporations attempting to practice greater sustainability and use renewable sources of energy kind of surprised me considering how much this class has convinced me of the selfishness and greed of politicians and corporate executives.

Hi Aubrey, I agree that this reading was helpful in large part due to its' simplistic approach. Throughout this course some of the readings regarding the actual science behind climate change has gone over my head. I attribute this to the scientists use of language, like you noted. To me, the scientists often provided excessively large amounts of evidence and statistics in the front of their papers that really had no resonating factors with me and left me wanting to skim the reading and perhaps miss their main points. As a result, I can definitely see how and why many of the concrete scientific findings regarding climate change has not been fully grasped by the general American public. For this reason, I liked the readings emphasis on scientists "turning their world" upside down. Ultimately, without these basic communication skills, I don't realistically see us climate change believers being able to clearly convince climate skeptics like Uncle Pete that this threat is REAL and desperately urgent. Also, from Ken's lecture I think that the idea of not initiating talks about climate change but rather waiting for others to ask questions is indeed an effective approach to educating others about the severity of the issue. Like Uncle Pete, a majority of Americans do not like to be told what to do and hate feeling a sense of intellectual condescension being thrust upon them. Finally, this is why I see an immense value in simply living and being about the change and only interjecting ways to help the climate in settings that feel right, otherwise opposition and skepticism has more opportunity to grow.

When I first stop consuming animal products, I had a lot of Uncle Pete's at our extended family dinners, kind of frowning upon me, behaving towards me as if this was some kind of craze or fad. In the beginning I was relatively defensive, trying to make my point, but when people have already made up their mind about something and don't want to listen, then whatever you say just goes to waste. 
   	                            <br><br>

The years passed by, and at every family dinner people would see the separate food I was bringing, eating, enjoying myself, not bothering anyone, and abstaining from consuming the traditional and delicious animal dishes that my family always serves. Slowly people started being much more interested and courteous towards my choice. Seeing that I was doing it a long time now, with good results, I think they started realizing that it wasn't just a phase after all, and became more interested. That's when my aunts and cousins started questioning me more about what I was doing. Then i had the opportuinity to talk briefly about many of the impacts that our diet has on the world.
   	                            <br><br>

I came to find out that people expect activists/environmentalists/vegans etc to be oversensitive and overemotional people. I was very intent on staying calm and talking about the facts and science. Although I do not consume animal products, i was willing to tell them that I would consume an animal dish to try something new and arguments along those lines, to prove to them that it's not that I ""can't" consume animal products, that it is not an emotional response, but rather an educated decision. It seems to be working, some of my closest friends have become vegan or decreased their consumption of animal products, and it seems like there are more to come.

Like Uncle Pete, they find it hard to believe how impactful a plant based diet is can be for environmental conservation. At family dinners, they ask me questions like "what can you eat?" as if I am only limited to fruits and vegetables. Little do they know, there is a vegan alternative to everything and as a result of the growing popularity of veganism, products and restaurants have increasingly accommodated to serve those with a plant based diet. I never expect my family members to go out of the way to cook me an entirely separate meal for me; however, at family events it can be frustrating to have very little options of food as they prepare it will animal products. Similarly, I also try to keep calm and collective when they ridicule me because I want them to take me seriously and not seem "overemotional" like Antonis has mentioned.

The first thing I asked my roommate when I heard she was vegetarian was: why? It turned out to be because of Cowspiracy and climate change. Weeks later, someone told me it was rude to ask why someone was vegetarian or vegan. I didn't really understand why it was rude, but after reading your comment, ("...people expect activists/environmentalists/vegans etc to be oversensitive and overemotional people), it makes more sense now. Activists are passionate about their causes, so it's easy to find examples of an activist getting overly passionate. When people think of stereotypes, they think of racist or sexist ones. Yet, people forget that other groups are stereotyped, such as activists. An environmentalist is not necessarily a tree-hugger or a socialist, despite skeptics and deniers arguing so. Activists are capable of being calm and rationally discussing their causes. Yet, it's really not easy.

 On the first page of content in Chapter 8, it is written that "many people, when attempting to communicate complex subjects, typically fail to craft simple, clear messages and repeat them often. Instead, they overdo the level of detail... in short, the more you say, the less [others] hear... [climate scientists] know a lot, so they want to say a lot." I feel that this is one of the most important points in the reading. If you like something, chances are you'll know a lot about it. If you're too excited, you might start rambling or ranting, which isn't what your audience wants to really hear. When faced with a lot of spoken content that's not interesting, I feel that people will react the same as skimming through an assigned reading to find a specific piece of information to answer a question. You'll be present for the entire page or conversation, but you'll only focus in on one or two phrases because that's what you need. Activists are especially prone to bombarding people with information because in order to be an activist you have to really care about the issue. Even if the facts are right, if an activist seems heated or biased, then the listener might just disregard the facts.

Also, I find it surprising that people look down on vegans. I know it has a lot to do with cultural differences, but I still find it absurd that people will dislike someone based on dietary choices. It's not like it's cannibalism or eating something outlandish. I understand that people might be affronted if you abstain from traditional dishes (props to sticking with your decision, by the way), but in other cases, I suppose people still aren't used to accepting change and difference.

 super answer Michelle, I think you described it perfectly. Veganism is stereotyped but as a more diverse audience adopts it then slowly it will stop.Vegan people should also understand that they need to be chill if they want to be heard and given credibility, as you said.

I strongly agree with Ken’s notion of communicating with the others about the climate crisis by telling when they are ready to hear about it rather than saying just because you are excited about that. Ken: “I do not advertise any of these lifestyle choices, but rather wait until people want – and are themselves ready – to hear about them.” I also think this natural way of communication is very effective, as only if your audience open to your opinion can they really start thinking in a different way and act accordingly. Ken’s own personal actions are also a convincing way of communication as that authentically shows Ken’s dedication into mitigating the climate crisis and his firm belief in the crisis. From this perspective I admire Ken’s way of communication, but I think it is actually highly powerful, although in a seemingly silent way.
    	                            <br><br>

Besides Ken’s lecture on environmental communication, I also found the reading very instructive and helpful, as it explains different communication strategies in detail. Previously, I think communication with my friends or family about environment is a relatively causal thing; now, I also think it can certainly be done in a casual setting, but there could be well-thought-out steps and methods to communicate. Before I read this, I once talked about this with a close friend of mine while eating dinner. She picked a beef stead and initially I didn’t say anything, but after she said: “Oh this stead is so hard to chew!” I said in a relatively joking tone: “See! What after eating beef!” But it turned out that she actually became angry, which evoked me to reflect on how to better communicate my will to preserve the environment. This reading and Ken’s own examples really help me to figure out the problem I’m facing.

There is a new device and technology that may assist in reducing cow’s methane emissions. Of course, the ideal scenario would be to completely eliminate human’s reliance on animal products but nevertheless, humans will continue to consume beef, poultry and other animals no matter what. A new company created a device that rests on the top of the cows’ nose that captures methane emissions that result from burping. This can capture the methane and transport where I can be reduced to carbon dioxide rather than the more powerful greenhouse gas, methane. While it doesn’t solve any problems, it helps reduce some amount of greenhouse gas emissions. I hope innovation like this continues to grow because every little change we make can help.

This week's reading of the "Communicating Climate Change Science" was very insightful and informative. This article took a different approach and focuses more on the communication and education of the climate crisis rather than the facts and statistics. Communication is the easiest way to fix the problem. We need to inform the public of the climate crisis and take steps towards resolving the problem. Scientists are starting to use technology to help the climate crisis. The methane device for cows would drastically decrease greenhouse gases. This device would be placed on the nose of the cow and there methane would be turned into carbon dioxide instead.  I agree with you and hope that innovation continues to grow so we can continue to find resolutions to climate issues. Additionally, we need to raise awareness of the climate crisis nationally and even worldwide and educate the public on how to reduce their carbon footprints and help our Earth survive.

The 8th chapter of this book about Communicating Climate change science was very informative. It gave the breakdown of 5 simple steps as to how to spread the message of the climate crisis. The Five steps included: preparation, stories, metaphors, language, and solutions.
    	                            <br><br>

Using these steps to convey the problem I believe is a thorough, clear and concise way of spreading awareness and I will be sure to try to take this into account when I do my part. 
    	                            <br><br>

Especially the storytelling and metaphor techniques, as I feel they are the strongest tools in your arsenal to make someone see from your point of view. I also think we should try to use pathos as many people tend to be motivated to take action based on emotions. A great example of this was used in the chapter that I pasted down below...
    	                            <br><br>

 “ I am convinced that confronting climate change is fundamentally a moral and ethical issue. It involves considerations of intergenerational equity. What do we owe to people who will come after us? Speaking as just one citizen of the Earth, I suggest that, at a minimum, we owe our descendants a planet that is as undamaged as the one we inherited from previous generations.” Damn.

I agree on using the pathos rhetorical device as a way to make "Uncle Pete's" understand the severity of the dangers that the climate crisis holds for our planet. If you are able to connect certain stories about the changing climate and its consequences with their life, they're more likely to listen. They are usually highly biased, going off on confirmation-bias most of the time. If you were to go against any of their false statistics or myths, they find you "annoying" or something related. The main people who are impeding the progress of helping reducing our carbon footprint are these people. One we're able to communicate with them properly, then we will see progress.

I agree, the 8th chapter in this book was very informative. The chapter basically tells us how to effectively communicate and spread the message of climate change science with the five steps you just mentioned. I agree that using these steps to convey the problems of climate change is a concise way to spread awareness. The techniques of storytelling and metaphors are extremely important, but I don’t believe they can be really strong without getting the first technique of “preparation” ready because it is really important to know the information and the facts of climate science.

I really like that quote from the chapter that you placed at the end of this comment. It says a lot, and it is motivational. We indeed do owe the future generations a much cleaner and safer planet even though we were not given one by the previous generations. We must try our best to fix this huge problem, and communicating the science to others is a great way to start.

I find it frustrating that there are so many Uncle Pete's in this country. I wish people were educated better and taught to trust scientific findings. Growing up, I never doubted scientists and was told by my teachers about climate change. I never had any reason not to believe in it and I find it strange that so many people doubt the existence of the climate crisis. It is especially concerning that this denial is continuing even though we are already seeing some of the consequences such as more severe climate catastrophes, like hurricanes and wildfires, in addition to melting ice and global temperature rise. I understand that the prevalence of Uncle Pete characters is largely due to the lobbying of the fossil fuel industry, as they have spent substantial amounts of money to propagate a disinformation campaign that is similar to the one carried out by the tobacco industry. However, it still makes me incredibly mad to talk to family members who simply refuse to believe in science, as though it is something you have a choice in believing in. I hope these tips from "Communicating the Climate Crisis" will help when I encounter Uncle Petes, but I doubt it because usually, Uncle Pete's disbelief of science runs so deep that nothing I say will change his mind. He will simply continue to believe that all of the facts I presented are part of a larger conspiracy rather than accept that perhaps all of these scientists agree because they are right. I hope that in the same way people slowly understood the health risks of smoking, as time progresses and the evidence of the climate crisis becomes harder to deny people will realize that the crisis is real and that we need to do something about it soon.

Hello, I completely agree with you that our nation is facing a significant problem when it comes to the denial of climate change. The lack of proper education and misleading information is deceiving individuals into ignorance. As a result, the United States of America has failed to reduce its carbon footprint. This so disheartening for me because our nation is suppose to be leading the world in emission reform but we lag behind other countries. As the producer's of 25% of our planet's carbon, we should be at the forefront of change, but certain organizations and individuals keep us from improving the crisis so that they can continue destroying the environment for money.

One thing that I respect professor Ken about is his ability to understand that the general population is not ready to hear what they must do to save the planet. Many people come out too strong about the necessities to save the planet or their own opinions and scare away the people around them away. It's interesting to see that professor Ken never pushes his ideas on people unless they want to know. Its fascinating to see as people are generally curious and want to know why. People that get too political or moral tend to be too emotionally invested and it can be a bit bothering. Ken shows that you can make people aware of the current situations without scaring them away or being annoying. The reading "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" is interesting as it shows the reasons why climate change is a big deal while disproving anti climate change propaganda simply.

How does one initiate talking about the climate crisis? This week's reading revolved around one main topic: communicating climate change science. I think this week's reading has to be one of my favorites because the information presented is applicable to some many aspects of life, not just the climate crisis. For example, in terms of the climate crisis, experts need to be able to communicate it in a way that is easy and simple for the ordinary person to comprehend. Which sounds simple, but is actually pretty difficult because for audiences who aren't believers in the climate crisis, they can easily misunderstand the situation and mislabel many experts as alarmists. Although tedious, it's important to put our best efforts towards effectively explaining the climate crisis in order to truly get the message across.

Whilst reading this chapter something I realize is that not only is communication important but also comprehension. Just like Richard Somerville said people do not like to hear about the climate issue if there are no solutions. I feel like you can talk to your uncle Pete about these climate problems all you want but if your uncle Pete does not understand then it really does not matter what you say. Somerville did help emphasize the idea that communicating about the problem can be beneficial. I feel like knowing your audience is super important, why? Let me explain. Let us say that you are talking to a group of heavy meat eaters who are also cyclists about how their cars are increasing their carbon footprint. They would not pay attention to you because they do not use their cars, they ride their bikes. However if your audience were California residents who use their vehicle to go to work they might pay attention to your topic of how using your car can increase your carbon footprint and it can be effective. Ken also brought up a good point when he said that a good time to communicate is when the other party seems interested. That way you can inform them and since they are interested they might act upon it.

I think by bringing people's attention first is the correct way to advertise knowledge about the climate crisis. If someone suddenly tells me about how bad eating beef is and how bad driving is, I will feel negative about the information and that person. Perhaps I will even do the opposite way. However, if I ask about the reason first and I'm curious about the reason, I will definitely accept everything she/he tells me, and perhaps follow his/her actions together. Sometimes interest is the best teacher. By attracting people's attention and let them ask about the information first, it can positively advertise the correct solution of changing the situation of the climate crisis.

Communicating the climate crisis to an uninformed audience is a touchy subject. If you go about explaining the crisis in a confrontational way the audience can easily get discouraged on understanding and feel attacked instead. No one likes hearing how their regular daily actions, such as eating and driving a car, are causing disastrous effects on the earth. I enjoyed the chapter in this book as it outlined the proper etiquette when it comes to informing skeptics and also people who are just not aware of their actions. Instead of proposing radical changes it is important to ease people into following changes that are more climate friendly.

The dog shouldn't bark louder than it can bite. This holds even more true one finds themselves trying to change the lifestyles of a whole population. Whether it's with someone like the members of our class, who are quite open minded to subjects such as the climate crisis, or if it's someone like Uncle Pete, who is less open then a closed can, the ability to back up your preaching with your actions will never hurt. In fact, many times it solidifies the arguments you are trying to make. For example, if you went to a barber who claimed he was the best in town, but everyone in the shop had some BUNS haircuts, you'd probably walk right back out. This is where I find living up to the message that you try and share with people to be important: how can you tell them to do it, if you don't do it yourself.

In the reading, I found it interesting that Sommerville went on to defend scientists and the scientific method. This was a good thing for him to bring up, as a lot of people have only vague ideas of what goes into publishing scientific research. Not only does information come from bonafide scientists, but it is also cross checked several times, by a variety of other scientists. The establishment of knowledge in the scientific community should be taken seriously, as it science is about seeking the truth, not perpetuating falsehoods.

This reading is relatively easy to read as compared to other articles written by scientists. Many scientists write articles that only scientists or well-educated people can read, but this article uses down-to-earth grammar and wordings. It also gives detailed explanations on words that are usually misinterpreted by non-scientists. For instance, scientists use the word “positive feedback” for something that has an amplifying effect, but most people would assume that “positive feedback” is something good because of the word “positive”. However, I personally think that certain parts of the article seem to be too informal. When it comes to Uncle Pete’s opinion and claims, the author strongly expresses his attitude with sentences such as “Not true. A few small mistakes did get into the reports, but none of them is important.” and “All of Uncle Pete’s claims are simply not true. They are falsehoods, not facts.” Using those sentences, the author just uses extreme words and attacks Uncle Pete’s claims without evidence or rhetoric, unlike most parts of the articles where he rationally makes claims and provides the reasonings behind.

I think the article does make a very good point that “we need to help people realize that not acting is also making a choice, one that commits future generations to serious climate change impacts.” It is important for people to learn about the trajectory that we humans are on if we do not act or do not act soon enough. We will need most people to respect climate science like they do with medical science and to accept what science has discovered.

As an international student, I think that many Americans, especially older generations, are excessively sensitive towards the word “freedom”. When I was in high school, my host mom always complained about a new act implemented by the government, because she thought these acts only “diminish the personal freedom of individuals”. For example, she hated the use of facial recognition system by the government, because she felt being monitored with such technology by the government ; but, to me, I thought such technology could be really helpful in ensuring people’s safety in life. In general, like the author points out in the reading, from the perspective of skeptics consisted of mostly older generation, climate issue simply gives the government a chance to make rules and regulations to “diminish the personal freedom of individuals”, which I think is really stereotyped. So, what can we do to mitigate this problem? I think a great way is to provide solution and the positive effect of it when communicating climate change issue, from which the skeptics can actually see how the government can help and provide them with a higher-quality life and become more motivated to support.

The way climate change science and statistics are communicated to the public plays a large role in its believability or skepticism. Oftentimes it’s not a matter of what you say, but how you say it, when trying to get people on board with any idea, policy, or lifestyle. It makes sense that addressing different social groups (religious, economic, cultural, etc.) with a perspective that appeals to their own values will make them more likely to understand the severity of the climate crisis and how they can play a role in the solution. Although, I hadn’t realized how much metaphors and imagery factor into one’s understanding of the climate crisis and scientific information in general.

Throughout this class and previous environmental science or studies courses I’ve found Vox videos, or those with a comparable style, to be a great tool for communicating climate science. I’m sure my previous educators, Professor Hiltner included, agree as they keep popping up in lectures and homework. Vox videos are so convincing and educational because they align with many of the points made in Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions such as using compelling titles and thumbnails to draw a viewer’s attention, simple graphics to provide visuals of processes, easily understood language, and straightforward facts. Unlike academic papers or other methods of scientific communication, I’ve found that these videos appeal to a broad audience while getting across many of the same points.

I found the reading this week to be very interesting because myself, and I’m sure many other people, have at least one “Uncle Pete” in life who drives patience up in the wall. In conversations I have always tried to remain very neutral, I never want to force my opinions on others and in return expect them to treat me with the same respect. The biggest issue that I have had when opening heated discussions about “controversial” issues, is that I often feel like I am delivering my side with logic and reason and in return am being shot down by uneducated and incorrect headline theories. You cannot have a productive conversation when it feels like you are speaking to someone who has their hands over their ears and is spitting out nonsense. My favorite part from this reading in particular is the examples Uncle Pete’s “myths and falsehoods” and how to respond to these with sound logic. I actually have tried to memorize a few of these so if similar conversations like these arise (which I’m sure they will) I can pull out these responses from my back pocket.

The break down of this chapter is the simple guidelines of how to communicate. Preparation, stories, metaphors, language, and solutions. We don’t always have to use all of them at one time because in general sometimes one alone is powerful enough, but to think about all 5 and utilize them in their best way will provide an increase in results. Just starting alone with communication, whether that’s to “easier” friends or family members causes a chain reaction. When people learn interesting information they absorb it and are more likely to then repeat it to other people. Everyone existing can do something about the climate crisis, and the bare minimum is really as simple as just talking to others by sharing AND receiving the information that is out there. As Ken says, our communication strategies leverage personal action, as well as “be the change you want to see in the world”. Our means to communicate to one another have more power than we think it does. If everyone in the human population were to talk about the climate crisis and ways to help, I think we would see change almost instantaneously.

I think the advice given to talk to people like Uncle Pete were really helpful because it really showed how we could put what we learn into good practice by informing others. I remember my first quarter at UCSB I learned about how my family and I weren’t being sustainable with the products we used and I went home and told my mom that I no longer wanted to use plastic or certain detergent. My mom did not agree with my practice and continued to use plastic and harmful detergent. Similarly when I tried to give up meat my mom did not understand why I wanted to do that and cooked meals that contained meat. I had I been able to successfully communicate my ideas and reasons I think my mom might have understood my reasoning. I think it is really important to be able to communicate about these issues.

After reading chapter 8 of Bending the Curve, I also agree with the advice given in regards to the concept of Uncle Pete. This part was particularly helpful, as I have family members who resemble Uncle Pete. They do not understand the full effects of the climate crisis and it sometimes becomes difficult trying to give them a solid and concrete explanation without a fight. While I am spending my time here at UCSB studying climate change, I want to educate and inform those around me to stress how important all of this information truly is. I once had to take an Eco Footprint calculator for a class to see how we are affecting the climate on an individual level, and I was shocked to find out how wasteful I was being as I consider myself a reasonably “green” person. I made my family take this test and found out that they were more wasteful than myself. I, similarly to you, communicated my concerns, as these statistics were frightening because not everyone lives with the same “eco-friendly” views as others. While to them it may have not seemed to be a big deal, I was still able to effectively communicate my own concerns about the environment and hopefully convince them to change even if it is only shown in small ways.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. Although many young generation people know global warming, some of the other may not know that or do not want to admit this for the reason that this may affect their properties or freedom, just like the fictional character Uncle Pete in the reading “Communicating Climate Change Science.” Then, it is our responsibility to help those people to realize that the climate crisis is true, and it is happening right now. To have the skill to achieve this goal effectively, several communication techniques mentioned in the reading—preparation, stories, metaphor, languages, solutions—are necessary to learn. First of all, finding communicators who are trusted by people can raise strong credibility with a specific group of people. More than that, it is also extremely crucial for the communicators of climate science to make their contents as clear, simple and straightaway as possible, otherwise, they may have opposite effects. Furthermore, in the lecture, Ken mentions that the best way to communicate climate crisis with other people is not to start a conversation about it directly but talk about the personal actions which they did first. By doing this, rather than being bored, the interests of the audience will be raised. Just like Ken said in his video that when others asked him about his diet, he would use the term “climacterian” and “freegan” to evoke peoples’ interests.
     	                            <br><br>
By using all these techniques for communicating climate science efficiently, the idea of protecting the environment will be spread, and the climate crisis can be halted, or even stopped.



<br><hr>
I agree with your actions, especially because I tried to do the same with my family. During the first part of this class when we learned just how harmful our actions of using plastic and eating meat were to the environment, I really tried to have a significant change in my consumption of products containing these. Me and my family had always known that it was bad for the environment to use plastic, but we thought that the benefits including convenience and ease outweighed the negatives. However, the lectures and videos from this class allowed me to realize that meat and plastic were terrible for the environment and even if we made small changes like using low-flow taps, a single hamburger could cancel all that water-saving for a year. I communicated these issues to my family, but to them, it was too large a lifestyle, and I feel that I am more inclined because I am exposed to this concept multiple times a week while they are only hearing it from me once.  I hope that we can spread this exposure of how detrimental these products really are to the environment and in turn mitigate and eventually stop the climate crisis we are currently in.

I agree with other students who are commending Ken for choosing such an interesting style of reading this week; in this course's readings we've covered the consequences of the climate crisis, to our own personal impacts, to how it takes place in the grand scope of politics, to even discussing how to communicate the scale of the climate crisis. In regards to how he communicates the dangers, he actually does a very dynamic and easy-to-follow method of teaching, making the subject very accessible to people such as myself, who were once unaware and uneducated about the climate crisis. This quarter, I took Comm 1 (Intro to Communication), and during this class' section on mass communication and small group communication, I took Ken's lectures into consideration and thought about if he was communicating the scope of the climate crisis correctly to his students. After thinking, it made me appreciate how effective he is at targeting both me, as one of his students, and the general Internet, who he aims to teach as well.

I would not be surprised if Ken took a communications course of some sort. I agree he has taught this course well. He makes it easy for me understand and I have confidence to share with others. That leads me to my next point. I have noticed that people who aren't in my class have found the information easy to digest. We have great discussions outside of class and it is because of videos like this. Before I was enrolled in this class, I acknowledged that climate change is happening but I did not know anything regarding solutions on a micro level. I knew the solutions on a macro level (switiching to clean energy, less airplanes, more high speed trains, etc).

I agree that just believing in climate change is not enough. There is almost no value if one is waiting on the sidelines, but in support of the cause mentally because the time is now and running out fast. In order to help elicit change we must make personal changes as we have talked about before. Wasting less food, Eating a plant-based diet, voting, having one kid, using mass transit, and buying less stuff are all personal changes that can show one's true belief in the issue. But, again these actions are not enough. It is great that some people do make these changes, however If other people do not make these changes, then the effect. is very minimal. According to "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions" we need to prepare ourselves before trying to get others on board. The way we go about communicating the issue is key. As Ken mentions in this video, before trying to encourage others to make sustainable lifestyle changes, the speaker first must walk the talk and make his/her own personal changes. Also, the author notes that research must be done prior in order to be knowledgable. I agreed with him when he says that no one fully understands or is impressed by a number of belabored facts, they want to know the basic, relatable, and easily understandable info about the topic. I know that the most shocking facts that stick in my head are that humans are dumping CO2 into the atmosphere at faster rates than the largest mass extinction in history, permafrost which stores potent hazardous gases is melting as we speak, electric cars are not as efficient as we think, cars take up 4.6 CO2 in a year which is more than our allotted CO2 emissions according to COP21, and flying is the worst thing one could do. These facts all imply that climate change is happening and hopefully will encourage those who have been waiting to do something about it. I personally, do not know any Uncle Pete's in my life which is actually a great thing. However, I know there are still many out there that do not want to face the science of it all and make it more a political issue about government power. This issue is not about the government power increasing, even if it was, the earth is dying here, so maybe it is about time the government took more control and got things done. This gridlock that we have now is the exact thing that deniers want. Stalling solutions from breaking ground  is because of the government. So yes, the government is an important aspect of the issue, but if the government is truly a democracy of the people, they must meet their constituents wants to remain in office. If all of the people can show their support to climate change, then even the most conservative of representatives will have to please their people if they want to keep their power. We must take back our power by voicing what we want and trying to get others to see the science and facts.

I strongly think that a huge component of climate change that prevents people from changing is the thought of radical change. Many allude to the thought that in order to decrease the effects of climate crisis they have to make radical changes to their life. On the contrary, by simply reducing the use of small things can have such large positive knock-on effects. For instance, if someone was to switch to electric cars as Ken mentioned, the production of electric bikes produces a hundred times fewer greenhouse gases than cars. Now at times, an electric bike may not be the most convenient for long transport, however, electrically coupled with the use of public transport can prove to be efficient and sustainable. Beyond this, no radical change is being asked of, but rather if we all changed our lifestyles slightly the overall effect will be so impactful. Further, in terms of the book "Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions", the use of informal language provides a very conversational perspective and allows for greater reader engagement, an example of this is seen through the use of language like "Uncle Tom's". Rather than using subject-specific lexis' the author doesn't which makes it easier to follow along. Moreover, the author also avoids being confrontational with non-climate change believers, the author suggests that we should communicate problems more communicatively in order to gain a stronger sense of understanding of why the climate crisis is happening and the solutions.

I agree with the point Ken brings up about not using your own personal actions or beliefs as a starting point to initiate conversation. Many people will instantly shy away, or become defensive-- either internally or visibly. Additionally, Ken brings up an important point about how people assume that you are taking a moral high ground when you discuss your eating/living habits. I used to try selling my friends on certain aspects of vegetarianism, but many of them inevitably thought I was trying to take a moral high ground. Eventually I gave up on trying to talk to people about my diet/lifestyle choices, and let it be. Like Ken pointed out in the video, I also had an opportunity to discuss my eating choices at freebirds out of all places. My friend was surprised that my veggie nachos were almost a full 6$ cheaper than their steak nachos with guac. We got into a conversation about some of the climate (and financial) benefits of being vegetarian, and now they order the veggie nachos at freebirds instead of steak-- a small change, but a positive one nonetheless.

I like that the reading mentions that confronting climate change is not just about science, but also about a moral and ethical problem. I never really thought about it this way. I know that this is most of what we have been learning about in this course, how humans are so selfish and need to relax on spending and everything, but it just hit me that these personal problems have a name. And it’s not just about the people that have problems with understanding science and don’t want to give in to the cause because they don’t like science, but it’s about the people that don’t want to understand that they themselves have and are the bigger problem.

I know people like Pete. People that ignore the problem because they don’t understand it. But they also don’t want to get educated on the problem either because they find the ignorance is bliss. This Uncle Pete story was a good way to self reflect and think about talking to the Petes in our life and talking about the facts behind climate change.

Ken has done an excellent job this quarter at being a climate communicator.  As soon as he laid out the course dynamic for us I could see exactly what he was trying to do.  By making all of his lectures and videos public and having us comment on every video he is creating discussion circulation around the topic of climate change.  When videos become increasingly popular on youtube they are more likely to turn up on someone’s home page as something that person should consider watching.  Therefore hopefully these videos have been getting passed around outside our classroom with ease.  As for the students, many of the videos we’ve found most interesting have been shared with friends, family, etc.  After taking Engl 22 I was excited to see where he wanted to go with this course, immediately I saw that it was less of a course and leaning more towards some sort of revolution that could begin right here at UC Santa Barbara.  I can only imagine how successful it will be if the course continues past this quarter.  His videos are interesting in that they are split up into very specific topics, so rather than having to watch a 2 hour long documentary on climate change you can learn more specific things if you choose.  This is especially helpful for those who are already educated on many aspects of climate change and are just trying to further their knowledge of one aspect.

From this week’s discussion and lecture, people’s diet is related to climate crisis when eating a largely plant-based diet and less food waste. Food waste is an enormous threat to the globe since it might could cause influences at different stages such as disposal and landfill issue. The consumption of food is far less than the production of food, thus people should work together about reducing waste. There are lots of families that dine outside and pack leftovers, but they do not actually consume those leftovers but let it sits in fridges. I would say such endeavors are like moral comfort to them.

This week's content has largely been focused on diet, and how choosing to lead a mostly plant-based diet can help mitigate food waste and the climate crisis, something Ken has repeated throughout the course. I agree that food waste is dangerous to us because it directly influences and disrupts disposal and landfills, bpth of which have structural issues. Because the production of food is so high and the consumption is a fraction of that, we must take it upon ourselves to reduce food waste and practice sustainable food habits in order to hope to mitigate the climate crisis.

I have to say that being vegans and vegetarians help nothing toward climate changes but are destroying their own bodies. It makes sense why people think being a vegan or vegetarian can help but I do not think this is the proper way. I have seen many vegetarians finally ended up in the hospital. Their bodies cannot support their behavior year by year; eating just vegetables cannot provide enough nutrition. Even if they might take nutrition pills, it's still not sufficient for their bodies. Once they get sick, they either decide to eat meat again or go to ICU after a couple months. No matter which way they choose, all efforts they have put in are done and more wastes will even be created for saving them. They finally end up saving nothing but making things messier. The best way is to eat less meat, not to not eat meat again.  We are saving this environment for human; if what we have done is not good for us anymore, why shall we still choose it?

I liked how this reading talked about how “Uncle Pete’s” are skeptical about climate action because they don’t want liberals and environmentalists being in control of strict rules and regulations that will affect their lives. It said that, ironically, if warming continues, countries like ours will face even more restrictions that are even more harsh. I have never thought about this argument before, but I will definitely be using it next time.

I appreciated the way they generalized climate change skeptics as "Uncle Pete". The stereotype reminds me of uncles of my own, who are stubborn to change their lifestyles for liberals or environmentalists as they just reject their ideas as extreme or based on unproven science that just limits the freedom they love. I think it is ironic as well that while so many people are against believing in climate change as it puts restrictions on their lifestyle, that everyone will face even greater restrictions when the consequences are so severe there are no alternatives. I will certainly use the argument again in the future as well.

I really enjoy the reading “Communicating Climate Change Science”. This reading is really organized and clear that the author presents his ideas and issues briefly and comprehensibly, making the problems easy to read and understand. I like the style in his writing since in every paragraph, there is a clear statement that could catch my attention and he also summarizes 12 main points from a thousand of pages report from IPCC. In this case, the audience, as me, are really motivated by his writing and could get close to the issues presented. I totally agree what he says that communication is really important in dealing with climate change. Techniques of communication could improve the effects of communication and enhance the involvement and enthusiasm of participants. I find that his ideas, like preparation, stories, metaphors, language, and solutions, are convincing and through his writing, I am totally convinced. Facts and scientific evidence are needed to persuade people to bring about actions. Languages and topics should be targeted to different people and different audience. It is our duty to play a role in taking actions to fix climate change and spurring others to get involved in mitigating climate crisis and saving our planet.

I also believe communication is really important when dealing with climate change. In terms of dealing with the climate crisis, I never really considered the significance of the way this information is provided. But now that I think about it, communicating climate change is crucial and has the power to influence people of the older generation as well as our own. Like you said, we all have a duty to take action to fix climate change, and talking with others to inspire them to get involved could be very powerful. When I think of climate activists, I often imagine mass protests and people on social media broadcasting the severity of our planet’s situation, but it all begins on a smaller level. For instance, intergenerational learning could be extremely effective, and this ties back to communication of climate change science. The description of “Uncle Pete” sounded very familiar, and if we all started by trying to reach out to these types of people in our lives, it could still be important, even if it may not feel like it. I think any and all efforts towards raising awareness of climate change are important, and we should all try to incorporate the methods outlined in “Communicating Climate Change Science” in our daily lives.

In the book ‘Bending the Curve: Climate Change Solutions”, the author lets me know how powerful the method of communication can be. We must fully understand all of the science and support our claims with scientific evidence and adequately communicate our points in order to provide more effectiveness. There is a counterargument that usually made by the people who deny being convinced about climate change that the weather pattern changes are due to the natural rotation of the earth. However, the author rejects and claims that “The orbital changes have much too small an effect to produce the observed large warming that has occurred in recent decades.” As a result, the authors use their own scientific findings and the ability to effectively communicate relay their proof of the existence of climate.
